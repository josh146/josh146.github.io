This apple cake comes together very fast, and has a wonderful nuttiness from the brown butter. It
might be surprising how thick the batter is (and the very high proportion of apple in the batter),
but when cooked the apple pieces melt into the cake seamlessly.

## Ingredients

* 140g unsalted butter
* 4 large granny smith apples
* 100g plain flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* Pinch of salt
* 2 large eggs
* 130g granulated sugar
* 1 tsp vanilla extract 

### Streusel

* 165g plain flour
* 100g granulated sugar
* 50g brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 60g unsalted butter (melted and cooled slightly)

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 175ºC, and grease a 9 inch (23cm) springform cake pan.

1. Melt and brown the butter in a small saucepan set over medium heat, until foaming and sizzling
subside, smells nutty, and there are brown bits at the bottom of the pan when you swirl and tilt
the pot. Make sure to swirl the pot occasionally and keep a close eye on it to prevent burning.
Immediately transfer to a bowl to cool. You can re-use this pot to melt the butter for the streusel
later (or now, so it has time to cool).

1. Peel, core and cut apples into 1 inch chunks. In a small bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt.

1. In a medium bowl, add eggs and whisk at medium speed until foamy. Add sugar and vanilla and whisk
again until smooth and pale in colour. Add half the flour mixture, whisk until just incorporated.
Add half the cooled brown butter and mix until combined. Repeat with remaining half of flour
mixture and brown butter. The batter will be thick. Using a spatula, fold in apple pieces until
well coated. Transfer into cake pan, and use the spatula to flatten and spread batter out to the
edges.

### Streusel topping

1. Mix flour, sugars, cinnamon and salt in a small bowl, and drizzle melted butter all over. Do not
stir the mixture to combine, rather, use a fork  or fingers to toss the ingredients together,
making sure not to over-stir or break mixture up into tiny pieces --- you want to maintain lots of
big clumps. Use your hands to squeeze and clump pieces together, then sprinkle the streusel
generously all over the cake.

### Bake

1. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a skewer inserted in the center emerges clean. Cool on a wire
rack for a few minutes before running a blunt knife or spatula around the edge to loosen, and
remove the spring form cake pan ring. If desired, dust top with powdered sugar just before serving.
Serve slightly warm.

## Notes

The cake will store well in the fridge for about 4 days. To reheat the cake, place it in the oven at 175ºC for 10-15 minutes.
