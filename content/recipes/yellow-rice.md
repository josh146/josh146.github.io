Growing up, we simply called this flavorful rice dish 'yellow rice', and for some reason we only ever ate it as an accompaniment to [[bamya assam]] and [[potato chop]].

## Ingredients

* Chicken bones (approximately 1 backbone, a few wings, etc.)
* 2 star anise
* 6 cloves
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 1 onion (finely diced)
* 1 tbsp ginger (minced)
* 1 tbsp garlic (minced)
* 1 tomato
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper
* 1 tsp tumeric
* 300g jasmine rice

## Method

1. In a frying pan, preferably the same one that was just used to fry a [[potato chop]] mixture,
heat oil in the pan. Add the whole spices --- cloves, star anise, and cinnamon.

2. Add the onion and fry until softened. Add the minced ginger and garlic until fragrant, then add
in the tomato and continue to fry until pasty.

3. Add the chicken bones and fry for a few minutes to coat.

4. Add the salt, pepper, tumeric, and cover the mixture with water and let it simmer for 20
minutes.

8. Rinse the rice, and add it to your rice cooker. Strain the chicken stock mixture over the rice,
and then add the chicken bones on top. Leave to cook as per your rice cooker instructions.
