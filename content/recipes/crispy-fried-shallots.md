## Ingredients

* 450g shallots (peeled)
* 475ml vegetable oil

## Steps

1.  Line a rimmed baking sheet with a double layer of paper towels. Set a fine-mesh strainer over a
large heatproof bowl or medium saucepan. 

2. Using a mandolin on the thinnest setting, slice the shallots.

2. Combine shallots and oil in a medium saucepan. Place over high heat and cook, stirring
frequently, until shallots begin to bubble, 2 to 3 minutes. Continue cooking, stirring constantly
as the shallots fry to ensure even cooking, until shallots turn pale golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes
longer. Working quickly, pour contents of saucepan into prepared strainer set over bowl.
(Shallots will continue cooking for a brief period after draining, so do not allow them to get too
dark.) 

1. Immediately transfer shallots to prepared baking sheet, spread them out into an even layer, and
season with salt. Allow shallots to drain, then carefully lift the top layer of paper towels and
roll shallots onto second layer, blotting gently with the first. Allow shallots and oil to cool to
room temperature, then transfer to separate airtight containers. Store fried shallots at room
temperature, and shallot oil in the refrigerator.
