## Ingredients

* 19g gelatin (bloom 225-230)
* 45ml cold water
* 200g water
* 200g cream
* 130g cocoa powder (regular or dutch processed for richer flavour)
* 300g sugar

## Steps

### Mirror glaze

1. **Bloom the gelatin:** If using gelatin powder, sprinkle it in icy-cold water in a small bowl,
mix well, and let it sit for about 10 minutes to let it hydrate completely. If using gelatin
sheets, soak them in icy-cold water for about 10 minutes.

1. In a medium saucepan, mix the water, sugar, and cocoa powder and mix until well combined. Add the
cream, and gently mix (try not to introduce air bubbles). Over medium high heat, bring to a boil,
and then remove from the heat.

1. Stir in the gelatin and allow it to dissolve. Strain the glaze into a bowl through a fine mesh
strainer, minimizing the distance the glaze drops to avoid bubbles.

1. Cover the glaze with cling wrap, pressing the cling wrap onto the surface to avoid a skin from
forming.

### Cake glazing

1. Ensure the glaze is at 30ºC (for a cake out of the fridge) or 40ºC (for a cake out of the
freezer). If you have just made the glaze, wait for it to cool to this range (it should take about
2 hours). If you are using refrigerated glaze, heat it up in the microwave and let it cool down.

1. Set a wire rack on top of a baking sheet lined with cling film or baking paper. If frozen, remove the frozen
cake from a silicone mold or cake ring and ensure that it is completely frozen --- place the cake
on the wire rack.

1. Immediately pour a generous amount of the glaze on top of the cake in a circular motion so you
can coat the sides of the cake all around. Next, immediately stroke the surface of the cake lightly
with an offset spatula to drop excess glaze and make it thinner. Move the spatula parallel to the
cake to create an even layer.

1. Wait until the glaze is no longer dripping, then
insert an offset spatula under the bottom of the cake and move it in a circular motion to cut off the dripped glaze. Transfer the cake onto a plate or cake board.

## Notes

* Pour the glaze into an airtight container. You can store it in the fridge (for a week) or the
  freezer (for a few months) To use, simply heat it in the microwave or a bain-marie.

* To store a glazed cake, you can leave it out on the counter if the room temperature is 22ºC.
  Otherwise, keep it refrigerated (but no need to cover the cake, the glaze acts as a natural
  covering).
