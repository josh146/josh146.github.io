This recipe is a riff on my [[one-pot chicken and rice blueprint]], adapted to allow for a one-pot
meat and rice dish where the protein, unlike chicken thighs, needs to be braised for a longer
period of time to become tender.

Often times, when I am making a red-meat braised dish, I end up with too much leftover (but utterly delicious) braising liquid I don't know what to do with, *and* I am sometimes too lazy to make rice. This recipe kills two birds with one stone: the same pot it used to cook the rice, *and* the rice absorbs all the flavours from the braising liquid.

Note that the braising liquid can get quite fatty depending on your cut of meat --- I recommend skimming some of the fat before adding the rice, as well as garnishing with lemon to cut through the fattiness.

## Ingredients

* 4-6 pieces lamb shoulder chops[ref]Or any other protein suitable for long braising, such as short rib, chuck, goat, etc.[/ref]
* 300g basmati rice

### Aromatic base

* 1 large onion or 2 medium onions (finely diced)
* 6 cloves garlic
* 1 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 tsp oregano
* 2 sprigs thyme[ref]Feel free to use any combination of thyme, oregano, mint, and/or rosemary. If you would like to add dry spices such as ground cumin or coriander, add this when frying the onion and garlic.[/ref]

### Braising liquid

* 400g canned tomatoes
* 1 cup dry red wine (optional) [ref]The wine is optional, if you don't have any just use water![/ref]
* 2 cups [[chicken stock|stock]] (optional) [ref]The stock is optional, if you don't have any just use water![/ref]

### Rice mixins

* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper

### Garnishes

Fresh herbs and other garnishes to add after cooking the rice.

* Fresh parsley, mint, oregano, or coriander
* Lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Season the lamb with salt. Leave to brine for at least 30 minutes. Sear the lamb chops in a dutch
oven for 2 minutes per side until golden. Remove from the pot.

1. Add butter or oil, and saute the onions and garlic. Add the tomato paste and stir to caramelize.
Add in the tomatoes, followed by 1 cup of water or wine. Allow to cook for 5 minutes.

1. Place the lamb chops back into the pot, and add the stock (and/or water) until the lamb chops
are *barely* covered by the braising liquid, as well as any herbs (oregano, rosemary, thyme etc.).
Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer, and leave to cook until the lamb chops are tender,
approximately 1-2 hours.

1. When the lamb is tender, skim off any excess fat, and bring the pot back up to a boil. Add in
rice, 1 tsp of salt, and 1 tsp of pepper. Reduce to the lowest simmer, return the lid, and cook the
rice until all liquid has been absorbed, about 25-30 minutes. Take the pan off the heat, and eave
the dish undisturbed for another 10 minutes.

6. Finally, add the {{garnishes}} and use a fork to stir them in and fluff up the rice. Taste and
add more salt and pepper if needed.
