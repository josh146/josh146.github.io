This recipe is a riff on my [[one-pot chicken and rice]], adapted to allow for a one-pot
meat and rice dish where the protein, unlike chicken thighs, needs to be braised for a longer
period of time to become tender.

Often times, when I am making a red-meat braised dish, I end up with too much leftover (but utterly delicious) braising liquid I don't know what to do with, *and* I am sometimes too lazy to make rice. This recipe kills two birds with one stone: the same pot it used to cook the rice, *and* the rice absorbs all the flavours from the braising liquid.

Note that the braising liquid can get quite fatty depending on your cut of meat --- I recommend skimming some of the fat before adding the rice, as well as garnishing with lemon to cut through the fattiness.

## Instructions

1. Season the lamb with {{marinade}}. Leave for at least 30 minutes. Sear the lamb chops either in a dutch oven for 2 minutes per side until golden, or under a grill for 5-10 minutes.

1. Add oil to the pan, and saute the {{aromatics}}. Allow to cook for 5 minutes.

1. Place the lamb chops back into the pot, and add the {{braising_liquid_and_herbs}} until the lamb chops are barely covered by the liquid.
Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer, and leave to cook until the lamb chops are tender,
approximately 1-2 hours.

1. When the lamb is tender, skim off any excess fat, and bring the pot back up to a boil. Add in
{{rice_and_mixins}}. Reduce to the lowest simmer, return the lid, and cook the
rice until all liquid has been absorbed, about 25-30 minutes. Take the pan off the heat, and eave
the dish undisturbed for another 10 minutes.

6. Finally, add the {{garnishes}} and use a fork to stir them in and fluff up the rice. Taste and
add more salt and pepper if needed.
