This recipe is my first attempt to recreate a recipe from MasterChef Australia --- a
[brioche doughnut-based dessert from Matt Sinclair](https://10.com.au/masterchef/recipes/brioche-doughnuts-with-orange-curd-coffee-crumb-and-latte-ice-cream/r190614cqjhu).
The following is adapted slightly based on my other curd, doughnut, and ice cream recipes (as there
are a few small mistakes in the official MasterChef recipe).

## Ingredients

### Brioche Doughnut

This is the same recipe as my [[jam doughnuts]], with all ingredients except the butter divided by
approximately 2.5, and the water replaced with milk.

* 40ml milk
* 20g caster sugar
* 5g dried yeast
* 1 egg
* 1 egg yolk
* 125g flour (plus more for greasing)
* 80g butter (room temperature, cubed)
* vegetable oil (for frying)

### Coffee Crumb

* 10g coffee beans
* 40g caster sugar
* 40g almond meal
* 25g flour
* 2g salt
* 25g butter, melted

### Latte ice cream

This is approximately 40% of my standard ice cream recipe, so this makes about 400ml of
ice cream.

* 100ml milk
* 150ml cream
* 1/2 vanilla bean, seeds scraped
* 60g cup caster sugar
* 30ml freshly made espresso
* 3 large egg yolks (60g)
* Pinch of salt

### Orange curd

Approximately one-third of my [[lime curd]] recipe (with limes swapped out for oranges).

* 3 large egg yolks (60g)
* 60g caster sugar
* 60ml fresh orange juice
* 40g unsalted butter (cut into 1cm cubes)
* Pinch of salt
* Zest of 1/2 orange

### Orange caramel glaze

* 60g cup caster sugar
* 40ml fresh orange juice
* Zest of 1/2 orange
* 15g butter

### Hazelnut and Pistachio Crumb

* 20g hazelnuts (toasted)
* 20g pistachio nuts (toasted)
* 1/4 tsp salt

### Garnish

* Gold dust
* Micro basil

## Instructions


1. Preheat oven to 180ºC. If your ice cream machine has a built-in compressor, turn on the ice cream machine to chill.

### Brioche doughnut

2. Place milk and sugar into a small saucepan and warm over low heat, stirring gently until sugar
has dissolved. Remove from heat and sprinkle yeast over warm milk.

2. Add the flour on medium speed and mix until combined and thick, about 3 minutes.

3. With the mixer on low speed, add butter a piece at a time, mixing until incorporated after each
addition. Once all the butter has been added, mix until the dough is smooth, shiny and elastic
(about 5 minutes). The dough should be tacky but not sticky.[ref]More flour may need to be added if
the dough is still sticky after mixing in the butter.[/ref]

4. Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and knead for a few minutes by hand. Place dough in a
lightly oiled large bowl, cover loosely, and leave to rise in a warm spot until doubled in size,
about 1 hour.

5. Uncover and knock back dough by folding the dough back onto itself several times to remove air.
Portion dough into 6 even portions and roll into balls, flattening them slightly. Place discs onto
a paper lined baking tray until doubled in size again, about 1 hour.

6. Heat oil to 170ºC. Add doughnuts in batches, and deep fry until puffed and completely golden,
turning over halfway to ensure even colouring, about 1 minute 30 seconds per side. Remove from the
oil and set aside on paper towel.

### Latte ice cream

7. Combine cream, milk and vanilla seeds in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat,
careful not to boil.

8. Meanwhile, whisk yolks and sugar until pale. Pour 1/2 of the warm milk over the yolks and whisk
to combine. Pour yolk milk mixture back into the saucepan of remaining milk mixture and add coffee.
Place back over low heat and cook, stirring continuously, until slightly thickened. Strain through
a fine sieve into a clean bowl and cool over an ice bath. Once cooled, transfer to pre-chilled ice
cream machine and churn according to manufacturers instructions until set. Once set, transfer to
the freezer until required.

### Coffee crumb

9. Combine all ingredients in a food processor and blitz to a fine crumb. Spread crumb onto a paper
lined baking tray and bake in the oven until golden brown, about 10-12 minutes. Remove from oven
and set aside to cool.

### Orange curd

10. Place egg yolks, sugar, zest, butter, and pinch of juice in a medium heatproof bowl and whisk to
combine. Place in a double boiler over boiling water, and stir with a spatula until thickened and
coating the back of a spoon.

12. Pass through a fine sieve and set aside to cool. Once cool, transfer to a piping bag and set aside.

### Orange caramel glaze

11. Combine sugar with 2 tablespoons of water in a small saucepan and heat to a dark amber colour. Brush down the sides of the saucepan with a wet pastry brush to prevent crystallisation. Remove from the heat and add orange juice, butter, and zest and whisk to combine. Set aside, keeping warm. 

### Hazelnut Pistachio Crumb

12. Place toasted hazelnuts, pistachios and salt into a food processor and blitz to a fine crumb. Set aside.

### Serving

13. To serve, divide coffee crumb between plates. Use the piping bag to fill each Brioche Doughnut
with some crange curd. Dip doughnuts into the orange glaze then roll the top of each in hazelnut
pistachio crumb. Place a scoop of latte ice cream to the side of the brioche doughnut. Finish with
micro basil leaves and some gold dust.
