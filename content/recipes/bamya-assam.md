An earthy sweet and sour stew, this bright yellow dish is the result of the merging of cultures -- an
Iraqi Jewish staple, made with south east Asian ingredients. The name is reflective of this, with *bamya* being the arabic word for okra, and *assam* the malay word for sour.
Growing up, we almost always had bamya alongside [[yellow rice]] and [[potato chop | potato chops]].

In particular, I find the calamansi
juice is **key** -- attempts to replace this with lemon or lime juice does not fully replicate the
flavours I remember from my childhood. This recipe has been adapted from [Rose's Family Favourites](https://www.jewishfoodsociety.org/stories/the-flavors-of-iraq-india-and-singapore-meet-in-th).

## Ingredients

* 1.2kg of chicken legs/thighs (about 8 thighs or 4 marylands)
* 10-15 ladyfingers or okra (halved)
* 1 large tomato, finely chopped
* 1 large onion, finely chopped
* 5 cloves garlic
* 1 inch ginger
* 5g mint leaves
* 120ml calamansi juice (about 8 tbsp)
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 3 tbsp sugar
* 2.5 tsp salt, or to taste
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 1 tsp turmeric powder
* 2 cups [[chicken stock | stock]]
* 3 cups water

## Method

1. In a large saucepot, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened and
   translucent; then add finely chopped or microplaned garlic & ginger, as well as the tomato. Cook
   until fragrant and tomato has softened; add water if necessary to prevent drying out.

2. Lower to medium low, and add chicken piece. Stir for 1-2 minutes, and then allow to cook for 5
   minutes covered.

3. Add tomato paste, turmeric powder, salt, pepper, and sugar. Stir, and add in stock, water, and
   calamansi/lemon juice.

4. Bring to a simmer, and then reduce heat to low, and cover for 15 minutes.

5. Add the okra. 10 minutes later, add the mint leaves.

6. Allow to simmer, covered, for 35-45 minutes.

7. Taste, and add more salt/sugar/calamansi until the desired sweet and sour profile is achieved.

## Notes

Replace the okra with beetroots, and the dish
transforms into [[beetroot stew]], a yellow-golden sweet and sour stew.
