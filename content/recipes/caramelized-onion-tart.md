I love caramelized onions, cheese, and savoury pastries, and this tart gives all of that. Feel free to adjust and adapt, for example using goats cheese in place of the gruyere.

## Ingredients

### Caramelized onions

* 30g unsalted butter
* 30g olive oil
* 4 large onions (about 1.3kg, thinly sliced)
* Salt and pepper
* 1 tsp sugar
* 3 tbsp (45ml) apple cider
* 6g fresh thyme (chopped)
* 4 large sage leaves

### Tart

* 1 blind-baked [[Pâte brisée]] tart shell.
* 2 large eggs
* 80g cream
* 1 tsp (6g) kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp pepper
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg (freshly grated)
* 100g gruyere cheese (freshly grated)

## Steps

### Caramelized onions

1. In a large saucepan, heat the butter and olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring often, until they softened (about 8-10 minutes). Reduce to low, add salt, pepper, and sugar, and cook, stirring frequently, until deeply brown and caramelized (45 minutes to 1 hour).

1. When the onions are done caramelizing, add the apple cider, fresh thyme, and sage leaves. Cook until the liquid has fully evaporated, and then remove from the heat to cool to room temp. Remove and discard the sage leaves.

### Tart

1. Preheat the oven to 190ºC with a rack in the center.

1. Add the caramelized onions to the tart shell, spreading evenly to form an even layer on the bottom of the tart.

1. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, and add the cream, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Whisk in 75g of the cheese, then pour the custard over the onions. Top with the remaining 25g of the cheese.

1. Bake until the custard is just set, 30-35 minutes. Cool for at least 15 minutes (or until room temperature) before serving.
