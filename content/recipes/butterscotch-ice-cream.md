A salted caramel base with the addition of dark brown sugar to add those butterscotch notes, this is
an adaption of the butterscotch ice cream recipe from David Lebovitz's [The Perfect Scoop](https://www.amazon.com.au/Perfect-Scoop-Revised-Updated-Accompaniments-ebook/dp/B073QZ26D4).

## Ingredients

* 75g sugar
* 170g dark brown sugar
* 60g unsalted or salted butter (cubed)
* 500ml heavy cream
* 180 ml whole milk
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 6 large egg yolks

## Instructions


1. To make the butterscotch base, spread the granulated sugar in an even layer in a medium
heavy-bottomed saucepan and cook over medium heat without stirring until the sugar begins to melt
around the edges. Using a heatproof utensil, slowly drag the liquified sugar to the center and stir
gently until all the sugar is melted. Continue to cook, stirring infrequently, until the caramel
turns dark amber in color and begins to foam a bit.

2. Remove from the heat and immediately stir in the brown sugar, butter, 125ml of cream, the milk,
and salt. The mixture will steam and bubble up vigorously, then the bubbling will subside[ref]If
the mixture seizes, return it to the heat for a few seconds whilst whisking vigorously.[/ref]

2. Pour the remaining 375 ml cream into a large bowl and set a mesh strainer across the top.

3. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks, then gradually add some of the warm butterscotch
mixture, whisking constantly as you pour. Pour the warmed yolks back into the saucepan. Cook over
low heat, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the pan with a heatproof spatula, until
the custard is thick enough to coat the spatula. Pour the custard through the mesh strainer into
the cream.

4. Stir the custard until cool, then cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled.

5. Freeze in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
