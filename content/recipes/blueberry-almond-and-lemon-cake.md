A delicious blueberry, almond, and lemon cake from [Ottolenghi's Simple](https://www.delicious.com.au/recipes/blueberry-almond-lemon-cake/cy6ehbic).

## Ingredients

* 150g unsalted butter (room temperature)
* 190g caster sugar
* 2 lemons (juiced and zested)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 3 large eggs, beaten
* 90g plain flour (sifted)
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 110g almond flour (ground almonds)
* 200g fresh blueberries
* 120g icing sugar

## Instructions

1. Heat oven to 200ºC. Grease a 9- or 8-inch/21-centimeter loaf pan with butter, line it with a
parchment paper sling and butter the paper. Set the pan aside.

2. Place butter, sugar, lemon zest and vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the
paddle attachment. Beat on high speed for 3 to 4 minutes, until light, then lower speed to medium.
Add eggs in three additions, scraping down the sides of the bowl a few times as necessary.

3. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt and almond flour. With the stand
mixer on low, add the dry ingredients in three additions, mixing just until no white specks remain.
Fold in about 3/4 of the blueberries by hand, then scoop batter into the prepared loaf pan.

4. Bake for 15 minutes, then sprinkle the remaining blueberries over the top of the cake. Return to
the oven for another 15 to 20 minutes, until cake is golden brown but still uncooked. Cover loosely
with foil and continue to cook for another 25 to 30 minutes (less for a 9-inch pan, more for an
8-inch pan), or until risen and cooked, and a knife inserted into the middle of the cake comes out
clean. Remove from oven and set aside in its pan to cool for 10 minutes before removing cake from
pan and placing on a wire rack to cool completely.

1. When cake is cool, make the icing. Add lemon juice and icing sugar to a bowl and whisk together until smooth, adding a bit more
juice if necessary, just until the icing moves when you tilt the bowl. Pour over the cake and
gently spread out. Let icing set (about 30 minutes), slice and serve.
