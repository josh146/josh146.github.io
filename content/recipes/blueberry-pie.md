This recipe from [Stella Parks](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-blueberry-pie-dessert-recipe) is
perfect --- a flaky rough puff crust, a mixture of fresh and wild blueberries, and coriander powder
to really accentuate the flavour of the blueberries.

Feel free to change things up if you would like --- play around with the berry and the spice, for
example blackberry and cinnamon, or raspberries and cardamom.

## Ingredients

* One portion of [[rough puff pastry]] (prepared for a double crust pie)

### Filling

* 565g fresh blueberries
* 225g frozen wild blueberries
* 30g juice from 1 lemon
* 195g sugar
* 1/2 tsp (2g) kosher salt
* 1/4 tsp ground coriander
* 50g tapioca starch (or 20g tapioca + 30g cornflour)

### Egg wash

* 1 large egg
* 1 large egg yolk
* 15g (1tbsp) heavy cream
* Large pinch of salt

## Instructions

1. Toss regular and wild blueberries, lemon juice, sugar, salt, coriander, and tapioca starch in a
large bowl, folding with a flexible spatula until well combined.

1. Scrape into prepared pie shell and top with remaining dough, using a solid sheet, cutouts, or a
lattice design --- I like to use a herringbone design as in the recipe image. Trim away excess
dough and refrigerate to ensure top crust is completely chilled, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile,
adjust oven rack to lower- middle position and preheat to 200ºC.

2. Whisk egg, egg yolk, cream, and salt in a small bowl. Brush over chilled top crust in a thin,
even layer.

3. Place chilled pie on a parchment-lined half-sheet pan. Bake until crust is golden, about 1 hour,
then loosely cover with tented foil. Continue baking until filling is bubbling even in the very
center of the pie, about 15 minutes longer. If crust completely covers filling, bake until pie
reaches an internal temperature of 101ºC on a digital thermometer. The time can vary considerably
depending on the thickness and type of pie plate, the amount of top crust, how long the pie was
refrigerated, et cetera.

4. Cool pie until no warmer than 29ºC on a digital thermometer, about 3 hours depending on the type
of pie plate (at higher temperatures, filling will be runny and thin). Slice into wedges with a
sharp knife, pressing firmly against bottom and sides of pie plate to ensure the bottom crust is
completely cut. Wrapped in plastic wrap, leftovers will keep up to 3 days at room temperature; warm
10 minutes in a 180ºC oven to revive crust before serving.
