The best roast potatoes are like glass; skin so crispy it shatters as you take a bite. This recipe
is adapted from [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-roast-potatoes-ever-recipe).

## Ingredients

* 1kg potatoes (peeled and cut into eighths)
* 1 tbsp (12g) kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp (4g) baking soda
* 75ml extra-virgin olive oil (or duck, chicken, or beef fat)
* Small handful picked rosemary leaves, finely chopped
* 3 medium cloves garlic, minced
* Freshly ground black pepper
* 1 tbsp potato starch

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 230ºC.

2. Add 1 tbsp kosher salt, baking soda, and potatoes to a large saucepan and stir. Heat water in a
large pot over high heat until boiling. Reduce to a simmer, and cook until a knife meets little
resistance when inserted into a potato chunk, about 10 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, combine your oil or fat with rosemary, garlic, and a few
grinds of black pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Cook, stirring
and shaking pan constantly, until garlic just begins to turn golden, about 3 minutes.
Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer set in a large bowl. Set
garlic/rosemary mixture aside and reserve separately.

3. Pour the infused oil/fat into a large rimmed baking sheet, and place in the oven.

3. When potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot for about 30 seconds to
allow excess moisture to evaporate. Add 1 tbsp of potato starch, and toss to coat, shaking the bowl
or collander roughly, until a thick layer of mashed potato–like paste has built up on the potato
chunks.

4. Transfer potatoes to the hot baking sheet and roast, without moving, for 30 minutes. Using a
thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn potatoes. Continue
roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times
during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.

5. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture. Toss to
coat and season with more salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
