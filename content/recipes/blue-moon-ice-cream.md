I've always wondered why lemon ice cream is so rare. Sure, everyone sells lemon sorbet, but
citrus-flavoured ice creams are the perfect combination of bright, sour, and creamy. 

This recipe is a recreation of [blue moon gelato from Gusto Gelato](https://www.instagram.com/p/DLWBC3qztZe/), one of my favourite gelateria's in Perth. A rich white
chocolate-infused ice cream base with a blueberry ripple, the understated white chocolate provides
a base that is elevated by the lemon and blueberry, leading to a fresh, vibrant ice cream that is
not at all heavy on the palate.

The white chocolate ice cream base is adapted from [David Lebovitz's caramelized white chocolate ice
cream](https://www.davidlebovitz.com/caramelized-white-chocolate-ice/), while the blueberry ripple
is based on [Stella Parks fresh-fruit ice cream swirl recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-make-a-fresh-fruit-swirl-for-ice-cream).

## Ingredients

** Blueberry swirl**

* 225g frozen blueberries
* 170g sugar
* 1/4 tsp (1g) kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp orange blossom water (or other aromatics, such as vanilla essence, almond extract, rose water, or orange blossom water)[ref]Aromatic ingredients amplify the blueberry's aroma, offsetting the muting effects of freezing temperatures.[/ref].

**Ice cream base**

* Lemon rind from 2 lemons
* 130g sugar
* 250ml whole milk
* 250ml heavy cream
* 250ml double cream[ref]Double cream is easy to get in Australia --- it is about 48% milk fat. When I'm in Canada, I usually just replace this with heavy cream. The difference is not too noticeable; without the double cream, the texture is slightly less smooth/more icy, but the flavour is better and it coats the tongue less.[/ref]
* 230g good quality white chocolate (finely chopped)
* 5 large egg yolks
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Instructions

### Blueberry swirl

1. Combine blueberries, lemon juice, sugar, and salt in a 2L stainless steel saucier. Make note of
the filled saucier's weight at this stage so the reduction can be tracked on the scale. Mash the
blueberries with a fork or metal spatula.

2. Place over medium heat and bring to a boil, continuously stirring and scraping along the bottom
and sides of the saucier with a flexible, heat-resistant spatula. This should take no longer than 5
minutes; if it seems to be moving too slowly, simply increase the heat.

3. Once the mixture begins to boil, continue cooking until reduced by 115g for a thin, saucy ribbon
or 140g for a thick, gooey ribbon. This phase should take about 6 minutes; while it's natural for
the timing to vary from one stovetop to the next, a significant delay may indicate the heat is too
low.

4. Strain the syrup into a heat-safe container and stir in the orange blossom water (or other
aromatics; see note). If desired, season with an additional pinch of salt, bearing in mind the
syrup will seem less sweet when frozen. Cover and refrigerate until no warmer than 4ºC.

### Ice cream base

While the syrup is chilling, get started on the ice cream base.

1. Add the sugar, milk, lemon rind, 1 cup of double cream and a pinch of salt to the saucepan and
warm the mixture. Once warm, turn off the stove, and cover and steep for at least an hour, or until
you are satisfied with the lemon flavor.

6. Finely chop the white chocolate, and place it in a large glass bowl.

7. In a separate medium-sized bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, then gradually add some of the
lemon-infused cream mixture, whisking constantly as you pour in the warm cream. Pour the warmed egg
yolks back into the saucepan.

8. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom with a heat-resistant spatula
until the custard thickens enough to coat the spatula. Strain the custard into the white chocolate,
and stir until the chocolate is completely melted.

9. Add the remaining 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 tsp vanilla extract. Stir to combine. Chill
thoroughly in the fridge, then freeze in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. While churning, place a flat glass/pyrex tray into the freezer.

10. Stir the syrup until viscous. Place a third of the ice cream into the chilled container, and
layer/drizzle the syrup using spoon. Place another third of the ice cream on top, as well as
another drizzle of syrup. Finally, finish by placing the final third of the ice cream, and by using
a knife or spatula to gently swirl and ribbon the syrup.

11. Return the container to the freezer to allow the ice cream to set, ~5-6 hours. Any remaining
syrup can be used as a sauce.

## Notes

* The amount of sugar, and cooking the blueberries down to reduce the the water content, is
  essential to make sure that the blueberry ripple doesn't freeze or go icy when setting the ice
  cream.
