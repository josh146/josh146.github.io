Kangkong (also known as water spinach or morning glory) is a leafy green common in Singapore
(often served as sambal kangkong), but much less common in Australia and Canada. In Australia, you
can sometimes find it at restaurants, but it will almost always be Market Price (alongside the
lobster!).

Here is a recipe for kangkong in garlic oyster sauce, a common side dish when I was growing up, adapted from [Ang Sarap](https://www.angsarap.net/2015/07/01/kangkong-in-garlic-sauce/). Note that this recipe also works great with kai lan rather than kangkong.

## Ingredients

* 1 packet of kangkong
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tbsp Shaoxing wine
* 2 tbsp Oyster sauce
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* salt
* oil

## Instructions

1. To prepare the kangkong, cut off the roots and discard. Cut the kangkong in half, separating the
stalks from the leafy tops. Further chop the stalks in half, and wash these first until cleaned.
Chop the leafy tops in half, and wash these next until cleaned.

1. In a bowl combine together Shaoxing wine, Oyster sauce and sugar. Set this aside.

1. In a wok add oil then sauté garlic.

1. Add the kangkong stems and stir fry for 1-2 minutes, before adding the leafy tops and stir-frying
until they just begin to wilt.

1. Pour the sauce and continue to stir fry until the vegetables is just tender but still bright
green.

1. Stir in sesame oil, turn heat off then serve.

## Notes

You can add some chili sauce or sambal to the sauce mixture if you wish. For a more traditional
sambal kangkong, add toasted belacan to the pan alongside your sambal and fry for a few minutes
before adding the kangkong.
