My ideal cookie is of medium thickness (not too thin and crispy, but not too thick and cakey), while
being somewhat flexible/melleable and with an ultra fudgy interior.

Feel free to experiment and add interesting flavour combinations, such as ground cardamom, miso,
MSG, etc.

## Ingredients

* 100g sugar
* 160g brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 115g butter
* 1 egg
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 150g plain flour
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 230g semi-sweet or dark chocolate chunks

## Instructions

1. Brown the butter. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, and continue heating
until it foams. Stir, and once the foam subsides and the mixture turns golden and takes on a nutty
fragrance, pour it into a small container to cool.

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste has formed with no lumps.

2. Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk.

3. Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula, being careful not to
overmix too much. This will cause the gluten in the flour to toughen which will result in cakier
cookies.

4. Fold in the chocolate chunks evenly, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes, ideally for a few hours or overnight.

5. Preheat oven to 180ºC.

6. Scoop the dough in even 35-45g (depending on your preference) portions, and place onto a
parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches of space between cookies and 2 inches
of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.

7. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown. Sprinkle flaky finishing salt on the cookie.

8. Cool completely.
