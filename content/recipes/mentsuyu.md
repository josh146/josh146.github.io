Mentsuyu is a concentrated Japanese soup seasoning, that is used to season almost everything --- from yaki udon, to hot noodle soups like kake udon and kake soba.

To use it as a hot noodle soup base, dilute it with 4 parts water for 1 part mentsuyu (the resulting broth is then known as kaketsuyu).

## Ingredients

* 125ml (1/2 cup) sake
* 250ml (1 cup) soy sauce
* 250ml (1 cup) mirin
* 10g katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes)
* 10g kombu (dried kelp)

## Steps

1. Add all ingredients to a medium saucepan. Over medium-low heat, bring the mixture to a boil.

1. Allow it to simmer for 5 minutes, before turning off the heat and allowing it to cool for another 5-10 minutes.

1. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve.

## Notes

* The mentsuyu can be stored in the fridge for a month.

* The used kombu and katsuobushi can be stored in the refrigerator for a week or in the freezer for
  up to a month.
