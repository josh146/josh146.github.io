A simple immersion blender hollandaise, courtesy of [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/foolproof-2-minute-hollandaise-recipe).

## Ingredients

* 2 large egg yolks
* 1 tsp (5 ml) water
* 1 tsp (5 ml) lemon juice
* 115g unsalted butter
* Salt, to taste
* Pinch cayenne pepper (optional)

## Steps

* In a cup just wide enough to fit the head of an immersion blender, combine egg yolks, water, lemon
  juice, and a pinch of salt. In a small saucepan, melt butter over high heat, swirling constantly,
  until foaming subsides. Transfer butter to a 1 cup liquid measuring cup.

* Place head of immersion blender into the bottom of the cup and turn it on. With the blender
  constantly running, slowly pour hot butter into measuring cup in a thin stream. If it is too
  thick, whisk in a small amount of warm water, 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time, to thin it out to
  the desired consistency. Season to taste with salt and a pinch of cayenne pepper desired.

* Serve immediately, or transfer to a small lidded pot and keep in a warm place for up to 1 hour
  before serving.
