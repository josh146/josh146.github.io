I adapted this recipe from a recipe for slow-roasted lamb shoulder from a free Coles magazine. Even though this is neither slow-roasted nor a lamb shoulder, the marinade works really well for roast cuts of lamb in general.

## Ingredients

* 1 3kg leg of lamb (or you can use a 1.5 kg half leg)

### Marinade

* 4 anchovies
* 6-8 cloves of garlic
* 3-4 sprigs of rosemary
* 100ml olive oil
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper
* Juice and zest of 1-2 lemons

## Steps

1. Make the marinade by placing all ingredients in a food processor and blending until you get a
creamy paste.

2. Using a paring knife, make 1-2cm slits all over the lamb, and rub in the marinade. Place the lamb
on a rack in a baking tray, and place it uncovered in the fridge for 2 hours up to overnight.

3. Preheat the oven to 240°C. Roast the lamb for 20 minutes, then turn the oven temperature down to
200°C and roast until the internal temperature reaches about 53-55°C[ref]For medium, remove the
lamb when it reaches 55-57°C.[/ref]. As a rule of thumb, the approximate total roast time is 20-25
minutes for every 500g. 

4. Transfer the lamb to a place, and rest tented under foil for 20 minutes to 1 hour. The lamb will
continue to carry-over cook, and will rise to 63°C (medium rare).

## Notes

The original recipe was very similar, but with the following differences:

- The lamb shoulder is coated with flour and seared first. Once cooled, it is coated with the marinade paste.

- Preheat the oven to a much lower temperature (150°C).

- 250ml of red wine is reduced by half in a dutch oven, and 500ml of chicken stock is added.

- The lamb shoulder is placed into a dutch oven, and slow roasted (turning halfway) until tender and falling apart, about 3 hours covered and 30 minutes uncovered.
