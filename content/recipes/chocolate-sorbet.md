[David Lebovitz's chocolate sorbet](https://food52.com/recipes/17877-david-lebovitz-s-chocolate-sorbet) doesn't make any sense. Taste it, and you'll swear it is ice cream --- it doesn't really compute that it has no eggs or dairy!

## Ingredients

* 555ml water
* 200g sugar
* 75g unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
* Pinch of salt
* 170g bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, finely chopped
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. In a large saucepan, whisk together 375ml of the water with the sugar, cocoa powder, and salt.

2. Bring to a boil whisking frequently. Let it boil, continuing to whisk for 45 seconds.

3. Remove from the heat and stir in the chocolate until it's melted, then stir in the vanilla extract and the remaining 180 ml water.

4. Transfer the mixture to a blender and blend for 15 seconds.

5. Chill the mixture thoroughly, then freeze it in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions. If the mixture has become too thick to pour into your machine, whisk it vigorously to thin it out.
