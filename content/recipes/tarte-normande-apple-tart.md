A delicious, custardy apple tart that is super easy to make --- no need to parbake the tart shell, simply add the apples and custard to the unbaked shell.

Adapted from [David Lebovitz](https://www.davidlebovitz.com/aux-pommes-french-apple-tart-tarte-normande/).

## Ingredients

* 1 unbaked [[Pâte Sablée]] tart shell.
* 700g granny smith apples (approximately 4 apples)
* 2 large eggs
* 100g sugar
* 250ml cream
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* Pinch of salt
* Icing sugar for serving

## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 180ºC.

1. Peel and core the apples, and cut them in eighths. Place the slices in concentric circles in the
unbaked tart shell. 

1. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar, along with the vanilla extract and salt. Whisk in
the heavy cream until the mixture is smooth.

1. Pour the filling over the apples in the tart dough. Sprinkle the top with 2 tbsp of sugar (or raw
sugar if available) and bake the tart until deep golden brown on top, about 45 to 50 minutes.
Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack.

1. Dust with icing sugar and serve.
