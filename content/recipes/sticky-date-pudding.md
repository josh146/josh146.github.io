I absolutely love butterscotch sauce, and sticky date pudding (as we call it in Australia, sticky
toffee pudding elsewhere) is a great excuse to have butterscotch sauce and ice cream.

## Ingredients

### Cake batter

* 250g pitted dates (roughly chopped)
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 250ml boiling water
* 50g dark brown sugar
* 80g unsalted butter (room temperature)
* 2 eggs (room temperature)
* 165g flour
* 2 tsp baking powder
* Salt

### Butterscotch sauce

* 100g unsalted butter
* 200g dark brown sugar
* 1 tbsp (15g) golden syrup (optional)
* 350ml heavy cream
* 1 tsp vanilla paste
* Salt

## Steps

### Cake batter

1. Preheat the oven to 180ºC. Grease and line a 23cm square baking tray with baking paper, ensuring
there is overhang.

2. Sprinkle 1 tsp of baking soda on the pitted dates, and add the boiling water. Leave for 10
minutes, and then mash the dates with a fork or potato masher until it has a thick, viscous
consistency.

3. Cream the butter and the dark brown sugar together. You can whisk by hand, use electric beaters,
or a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat until combined.
Note that if the egg or butter is too cold, the mixture might split --- this is fine, it will
come together again when you add the dry ingredients.

4. Add the flour and the baking powder, and whisk/beat gently until just combined. Add the date
mixture, and fold with a spatula until combined and homogeneous.

5. Pour into the baking tray, and bake until a cake tester comes out clean --- about 30 minutes.

### Butterscotch sauce

1. As the cake bakes, make the butterscotch sauce. Mix the butter, brown sugar, golden syrup, and heavy cream in a small saucepan. Add a good pinch
  of salt. Place the pot on medium-high heat, and stir occasionally.

1. Once the butter has melted, bring the pot up to a simmer for about 2 minutes, until it has
  thickened slightly and coats the back of a spoon.

1. Remove from the heat, and stir in 1 tsp vanilla paste.

1. Once the cake is ready, immediately poke holes all over the cake. Pour approximately a quarter of
  the warm butterscotch sauce all over the cake, allowing it to permeate and soak in (about 10
  minutes).

### Serving

1. Cut pieces and serve warm, with vanilla ice cream and extra butterscotch sauce.

## Notes

* Sticky date pudding reheats wonderfully in the microwave as it is so moist. Simply cut into
  serving sizes and microwave until warm, and serve alongside the warmed-up butterscotch sauce and
  ice cream.
