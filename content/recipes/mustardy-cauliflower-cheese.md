This cauliflower cheese is so easy to make (since it bypasses the need for a bechemal) and so
delicious (due to the mustard, cumin, and other spices), that I have basically stopped making
regular cauliflower cheese.

Adapted from [Ottolenghi's Simple](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/nov/23/yotam-ottolenghis-mustardy-cauliflower-cheese), this
version ups the amount of cheese and breadcrumbs, replaces the parsley with coriander, and pan
roasts the cauliflower rather than steaming it.

## Ingredients

* 1 cauliflower (cut into 3cm florets, maximizing flat surface area)
* 1 brown onion (finely diced)
* 1 tsp mustard powder
* 2 tsp cumin seeds
* 1 tsp garam masala
* 1/2 tsp kashmiri chilli powder
* 1 tsp black mustard seeds
* 200ml cream
* 100g cheddar cheese (freshly grated)
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* Butter
* Oil

### Crumb topping

* 40g cheddar cheese (freshly grated)
* 40g breadcrumbs
* 10g coriander leaves (chopped)

## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 180ºC.

1. Heat a stainless steal pan over high heat, and add 3-4 tbsp oil. Add the cauliflower and a large
pinch of salt, and pan roast, shaking occasionally, until seared (6-8 minutes). Add more oil if
needed. Remove from the pan, add to a bowl, and cover with aluminium foil to steam for a further 2
minutes.

1. Add a large pat of butter to the pan, and fry the onions over medium heat until softened. Add the
mustard powder, cumin seeds, garam masala, and kashmiri chilli powder, and continue to fry for 3-4
minutes. Add the black mustard seeds, and fry for an additional minute.

1. Add the cream, cheddar, and 1/2 tsp of kosher salt, and saute for 1-2 minutes until thickened.
Stir in the cauliflower, and turn off the heat.

1. Mix the crumb ingredients together, and sprinkle evenly over the pan. Place the pan into the oven
for about 8 minutes, and then finish under the grill for 3-4 minutes until the top is golden and
crispy.
