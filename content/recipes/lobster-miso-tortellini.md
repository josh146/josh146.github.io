This recipe is another attempt to recreate a winning recipe from MasterChef Australia (after the [[Brioche doughnuts with orange curd and latte ice cream]] attempt).

This recipe is from Amira Elshafei, and it took me a while to perfect it as there is an unfortunate series of typos on the [MasterChef Australia official recipe](https://10.com.au/masterchef/recipes/lobster-stuffed-tortellini-with-lobster-miso-bisque/r200505vjtiw) --- in particular, there is a glitch in the miso bisque ingredients list, with the ingredient amounts accidentally shifted, showing the quantity for the ingredient *below*.

I didn't realize this the first time making this (and vaguely wondered what 1 clove of mushrooms meant), and ended up adding 120g of miso to the broth! While incredibly salty, it was still delicious enough for me to tackle this again with the corrected amounts.

## Ingredients

[[Component: Fresh pasta]]

### Shiitake salt

* 12 (120g) shiitake mushrooms
* 1/4 tsp fine salt

### Lobster filling

* 240g lobster meat (approx. from 1 large or 3 small tails; reserve shells for bisque)
* 6 fresh shiitake mushrooms (finely diced)
* 2 tbsp yellow zucchini (finely diced)
* 1 clove garlic (grated)
* 1 tbsp butter
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
* 1 egg (whisked)

### Lobster and miso bisque

* Reserved lobster shells (chopped)
* 1 tbsp brown rice miso
* 6 fresh shiitake mushrooms (halved)
* 1 clove garlic, crushed
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tsp white sugar
* 500ml water (enough to cover shells)
* 2 tbsp (30ml) pure cream
* ½ tbsp (10g) unsalted butter
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Buttered yellow zucchini

* 400g yellow zucchini, sliced into 1cm rounds
* 25g unsalted butter
* 1 tsp olive oil
* Small fresh basil leaves, to garnish

### Garlic and chive oil

* 250ml olive oil
* 1 bunch fresh chives (roughly chopped)
* 1 clove garlic (thinly sliced)

## Steps

[[Component: Fresh pasta|Pasta dough]]

### Shiitake salt

1. Preheat the oven to 120ºC. Thinly slice the shiitake mushrooms and place them in a single layer
on a baking tray lined with baking paper.

1. Bake for 45 minutes or until dried and crisp (but not burnt). Cool completely, then blitz in a
spice grinder to a fine powder. Mix with 1/4 tsp salt, and set aside.

### Garlic and chive oil

1. Place the oil and garlic in a small saucepan over low heat. Heat until the garlic just begins to turn a pale golden color (do not brown it, or it will taste bitter). Remove from heat and let it cool for 5 minutes.

1. Place the oil (discarding the garlic slices) and the fresh chives into a high-speed blender. Blitz on high for 1–2 minutes until the oil is a vibrant, deep green.

1. Strain through a coffee filter or a fine-mesh sieve lined with muslin cloth.

### Lobster filling

1. Chop the lobster meat into small 1 cm cubes, keeping the shells for the bisque.

1. Heat a frying pan over medium heat. Add the butter, and once foaming, add the diced mushrooms,
diced zucchini, garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook for 3 minutes. Add the lobster meat and cook for 1–2
minutes until just cooked through. Transfer to a plate to cool to room temperature.

1. Once cool, drain any excess liquid from the mixture so the pasta doesn't get soggy. Stir in half
of the whisked egg to bind the mixture.

### Lobster and miso bisque

1. Heat olive oil in a deep frying pan or pot over medium heat. Add the lobster shells and garlic;
cook until the shells turn bright red. Add the halved mushrooms and fry until golden (approx. 2
minutes). Add the miso paste and sugar; fry briefly until the miso softens.

1. Add the water until the shells are just covered, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover,
and simmer for 15 minutes to infuse the flavors.

1. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve into a clean saucepan (discard solids). Add the cream and
butter to the strained bisque, whisk to combine, and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.

### Assemble the tortellini

1. Divide the rested dough into 4 portions (keep covered while working). Roll one portion through a
pasta machine until it is roughly **1–2mm thick**.

1. Use a 10cm round cutter to cut out circles (aim for 8 per sheet). Brush the edge of each
circle with the remaining whisked egg, and place a heaped teaspoon of filling in the center. Fold
over to create a half-moon, pressing edges to seal tightly (ensure no air is trapped). Bring the
two corners together around your finger and pinch to form the tortellini shape.

### Cook and serve

1. **For the zucchini:** In a pan, heat the butter and olive oil. Add the zucchini rounds and cook until tender and slightly golden. Season with salt.

2. **For the pasta:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the tortellini for about 3 minutes (until they float and are al dente). Drain gently.

3. **To plate:** Place the buttered zucchini rounds in the bowl. Top with the tortellini. Pour the warm miso bisque over the pasta. Garnish with fresh basil, drops of the garlic and chive oil, and a dusting of the Shiitake Salt.

## Notes

* Don't overcook the lobster filling. It will cook again inside the pasta, so remove it from the
  heat as soon as it turns opaque in the pan.

* Different brands of brown rice miso vary in saltiness. Taste your bisque before adding the final
  seasoning.
