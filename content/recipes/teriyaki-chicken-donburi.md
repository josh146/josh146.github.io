One of my favourite Japanese restaurants while at university was [Satsuki](https://www.instagram.com/satsukiperth/), a fine-dining Japanese restaurant near the Subiaco train
station. What was so great about Satsuki were the super affordable takeaway donburi --- for $12,
you could get a super high quality tuna donburi (with tataki, negitoro, garnishes) or teriyaki
chicken (with chicken saboro, soy sauce egg, crispy shallots, etc.).

Unfortunately Satsuki has long closed down, but this is my attempt to recreate the Satsuki teriyaki
chicken donburi.

## Ingredients

* 350g thigh fillets (skin on, bone removed)
* 500g chicken mince
* Steamed jasmine rice

### Teriyaki sauce

* 1 cup soy sauce
* 1 cup sake
* 1 cup mirin
* 80-100g sugar
* 2 tsp minced ginger

[[Component: soy sauce eggs]]

[[Component: crispy fried shallots]]

### Garnish

* Spring onion (finely sliced)
* Pickled ginger
* Pickled shiitake

## Instructions

[[Component: soy sauce eggs]]

[[Component: crispy fried shallots]]

### Chicken

1. Combine the teriyaki sauce ingredients in a small bowl or cup and mix well until the sugar dissolves.

2. If the thickness of the chicken is uneven, place a fillet on a cutting board, skin side down, make a cut horizontally and outward where the meat is thick and butterfly it. Poke the skin with the tip of the knife in several places so that the sauce will get through to the flesh better.

3. In a frying pan, brown the chicken mince in oil and ginger, and pour over half of the marinade. Leave to simmer.

4. Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Place the chicken in the pan, skin side down. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the skin gets cooked to a golden brown. Turn the chicken over and cook for about 3 minutes. If a lot of oil comes out of the chicken fat and skin, absorb excess oil with a paper towel.

5. When the chicken is nearly cooked, add about 1/3 of the sauce, shake the pan to even out the sauce, and put the lid on. Cook for 30 seconds. Remove the lid and cook until the sauce thickens and reduces to about 1-1.5 tablespoons. Turn the chicken over and coat the skin side with the sauce.

6. Remove the pan from the heat and place the chicken on the cutting board, skin side up. Cover with foil for few minutes to let it cook further. Slice the chicken into 1.5-2cm thick pieces. Continue heating the sauce in the frying pan until it becomes a glaze.

### Assembly

7. Add the rice to a bowl, and top with the saboro and sliced chicken thighs. Poor over the glaze
and left-over marinade. Garnish with the marinated egg, chopped spring onion, pickled shiitake and
ginger, and crispy shallots.
