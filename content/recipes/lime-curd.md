## Ingredients

* 115g unsalted butter (cut into 1cm cubes)
* 180ml freshly-squeezed lime juice (about 5-6 limes)
* 140g sugar
* zest of two limes, unsprayed (see Note)
* pinch of salt
* 3 large egg yolks
* 3 large eggs

## Steps

1. In a glass bowl over a saucepan filled with simmering water, warm the butter, lime juice, sugar,
zest, and salt.

1. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and the yolks.

1. When the butter has melted and the mixture is warm, gradually pour some of the warm lime juice
mixture into the eggs, whisking constantly. Scrape the warmed eggs back into the double boiler and
cook the mixture over low heat.

1. Stir the mixture constantly over low heat, using the whisk, until the filling thickens and begins
to resemble soft jelly. Do not let it boil. When done, strain the curd through a fine-mesh sieve.
