Inspired from the traditional Japanese preparation kasuzuke, where protein and vegetables are marinated in leftover sake lees and then grilled, this recipe was made famous by Nobu Matsuhisa.

## Ingredients

* 60g white miso paste
* 60ml (1/4 cup) sake
* 60ml (1/4 cup) mirin
* 40g (3 tbsp) sugar
* 4 black cod fillets (about 150g each)

## Steps

* Bring sake and mirin to a boil in a small saucepan. Turn the heat down to low, and add the mirin
  and sugar, whisking until dissolved. Remove from heat and cool until room temperature.

* Rub mixture all over the cod fillets. Transfer to a ziplock bag or sealed container, and marinate
  for 30 minutes or up to 2 days.

* Cover a pan with baking paper or aluminium foil, spray with a neutral oil, and place cod fillets
  on top. Set the top oven rack approximately 15cm below the griller. Turn griller to high, and
  place tray with the cod directly under the griller, until top surface is charred (about 10
  minutes)
