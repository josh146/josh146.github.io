## Ingredients

* 4 - 5 large eggs (plus more in case any of the eggs crack!)
* 3/4 cup (200g) mirin
* 1/4 cup (60g) soy sauce
* 1/4 cup (60g) dark soy sauce (can be substituted with an equal amount of regular soy sauce)
* 1 tbsp brown sugar

## Steps

1. Place the marinade ingredients in a tall container with an air-tight lid. Whisk to combine(if you
added sugar, make sure the sugar is completely dissolved). The basic marinade is now ready. If you
want to infuse the marinade with more flavour, place it in a small saucepan, along with 1/4 cup of
water. Add chili, or garlic, or ginger, or star anise (or all), and bring the marinade to a simmer.
As soon as the sauce starts to simmer, remove it from the heat and let it cool to room
temperature.

2. Fill a saucepan with some water. Make sure the pot is large enough for the eggs to sit at the
bottom in one layer, and to have about 1 inch of water above the eggs. Add some salt or a little
vinegar to the water (this is to prevent the egg whites from running out if there's any cracking of
eggs while cooking).

3. Bring the water to a boil over high heat with the lid on. Then lower the heat to medium or medium
high, so that the water is still bubbling but not at a rolling boil (the eggs are more likely to
crack at a rolling boil).

4. Lower each egg gently into the water. As soon as you've lowered all the eggs into the water,
place the lid back on, and immediately set the timer for 6 minutes and 30 seconds for a set white,
and jammy egg yolk.

5. When the time is up, remove the eggs and immediately place them in a bowl with cold running water, for at least 2-3 minutes.

6. Carefully peel the eggs by gently tapping them on a hard surface to create little cracks along
the surface. Once peeled, place the eggs in the (cooled) marinade.
Let the eggs marinate for at least for 2 hours, 8-12 hours for best results, or even up to 24
hours.

8. Remove the eggs from the marinade and place them in a separate air-tight container. These can be
stored in the fridge for up to 4 days. Keep the rest of the marinade in an air-tight container in
the fridge. This can be re-used for up to 3 weeks.
