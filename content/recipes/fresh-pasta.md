I like to use half 00 flour and half semolina flour for my pasta dough, as I find the semolina adds a nice hue and sturdiness to the fresh pasta.

## Ingredients

* 200g 00 flour
* 200g semolina flour
* 4 eggs

## Steps

### Pasta dough

1. Place the flour and eggs in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix until the ingredients come together. If the dough is dry, add water one tablespoon at at time. Knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, and then wrap tightly in cling film and rest for at least 30 minutes.

### Shaping the pasta

1. Divide the rested dough into 100g portions. Roll each portion out using your pasta machine directions (keeping the other portions covered).

1. Once shaped/cut, dust the pasta with semolina and leave it covered, in nests, on baking sheets until ready to use (or drape it on a drying rack). Pasta nests can be transferred to a ziplock back and frozen for up to 3 weeks (cook directly from frozen).

### Cooking the pasta

1. Boil for 2-3 minutes until al dente.

## Notes

If using the Kitchen Aid pasta attachment, roll out the pasta to the following thickness settings:

* 4 for egg noodles
* 4-5 for lasagna, fettuccine, spaghetti, and ravioli
* 6-7 for tortellini, thin fettuccine, and linguini fini
* 7-8 for angel-hair pasta/capellini or very fine linguini

For rolling, use speed setting 2. For cutting fettuccine, speed 5, and for spaghetti speed 7.
