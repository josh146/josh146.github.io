A traditional cacio e pepe recipe, and something I still haven't been able to perfect. Every time I
make it the pecorino still tends to sieze, indicating that the pan is still too hot when adding the
cheese. I have attempted to make the sauce in advance (with cornflour to thicken and stabilize it,
like they commonly do in restaurants) and this worked out much better, but I still want to aim to
nail the traditional version.

## Ingredients

* 2 tsp black peppercorns
* 200g spaghetti
* 80g pecorino romano (finely grated, room temp)

## Instructions

1. Toast the peppercorns in a very hot, dry pan until fragrant, then roughly crush.

1. Bring a wide shallow pan of well-salted water to the boil, then add the pasta; it should be
covered but not by much. Stir occasionally during cooking and, five minutes into the cooking time,
scoop out 250ml water into a wide bowl to allow it to cool slightly.

1. Drain the pasta and leave it to cool for a minute. Meanwhile, put the cheese and most of the
pepper in a large, heavy bowl or pan and whisk in some of the pasta water very gradually to make
first a paste, and then a sauce the consistency of bechamel. Add the pasta and toss furiously while
adding enough of the water (you shouldn’t need it all) to make a sauce that coats each strand.
Don’t worry if it takes a while to come together – keep beating and it should happen.

1. Divide between warm bowls, sprinkle over a little more pepper, and serve immediately.
