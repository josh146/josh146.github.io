## Ingredients

* 1L of [[awase dashi]] (ideally niban dashi, or second dashi)[ref]If you want to avoid making ichiban dashi (first dashi), you can bring the kombu and bonito flakes to a simmer directly for 5-10 minutes.[/ref]
* 100g of miso (white or red)

### Optional toppings

* 15g dried wakame seaweed
* 200g silken tofu (cut into cubes)
* 100g mushrooms (shiitake or shimeji)

### Garnish

* Spring onions (thinly sliced)

## Steps

1. Place the dashi over low heat to keep it warm. Using a small strainer, mix in the miso with the back of a spoon. 

2. Add the toppings, and allow to rehydrate/warm up without letting the soup come to a simmer (approximately 5 minutes).

3. Serve, garnishing with the spring onion.
