A blueprint for a basque cheesecake, originally based on the one from [Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/basque-burnt-cheesecake), although that recipe seems to have
been updated over the last few years with differing ingredient amounts.

Note that there is quite a bit of variation online with basque cheesecakes --- whether flour
is added (or not), when to add flavourings (with the butter and sugar or with the cream), however
the version below has always worked out well for me.

## Ingredients

* Unsalted butter (for pan)
* 900g cream cheese, room temperature
* 300g sugar
* 6 large eggs
* 480ml heavy cream
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

{{wet_list}}

### Dry ingredients

* 40g all-purpose flour (optional)

{{dry_list}}

### Special Equipment

* A 10 inch or 25cm-diameter springform pan


<pre id="variation-yaml" style="display:none;">
Theme: Chocolate
wet_list: 375g dark chocolate (chopped)
chocolate_step: Heat the cream, and pour over the dark chocolate to form a ganache. Leave it aside to cool slightly; if added to the cold cream cheese mixture while still too warm, it might seize.
dry_list: 15g cocoa powder; 2 tsp instant coffee
cream: ganache

---

Theme: Pistachio
wet_list: 1 cup (about 200g) pistachio paste; 1 tsp lemon juice; Green food colouring (optional)
pistachio_step: Stir in the lemon juice and the pistachio paste. If a deeper green color is desired, add a few drops of green food coloring.

## Steps

1. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 200ºC. Butter pan, then line with 2 overlapping sheets of parchment, making sure parchment comes at least 5cm above top of pan on all sides. 

1. Beat cream cheese and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-low speed, scraping down sides of bowl, until very smooth, no lumps remain, and sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes.

{{chocolate_step}}

1. Increase speed to medium and add eggs one at a time, beating each egg 15 seconds before adding the next. Scrape down sides of bowl, then reduce mixer speed to medium-low. Add {{cream}}, salt, and vanilla and beat until combined, about 30 seconds.

{{pistachio_step}}

1. Turn off mixer and sift the {{dry_ingredients}} evenly over cream cheese mixture. Beat on low speed until incorporated, about 15 seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl (yet again) and continue to beat until batter is very smooth, homogenous, and silky, about 10 seconds.

1. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake cheesecake until deeply golden brown on top and still very jiggly in the center, 60–65 minutes.

1. Let cool slightly (it will fall drastically as it cools), then unmold. Let cool completely. Carefully peel away parchment from sides of cheesecake.
