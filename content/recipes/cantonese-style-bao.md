Unlike northern Chinese bao dough (which has a bit of chew), Cantonese bao dough is exceptionally fluffy, sweeter, and has very little chewiness --- a result of using low-protein flour, more sugar, an alkaline dough, and western-style leavening agents.

The following bao dough is adapted from the recipe for char siu bao from [Yi Reservation](https://yireservation.com/recipes/steamed-bbq-pork-bun/), but can be used for *any*
sweet or savoury filling, such as hoisin duck, or salted egg yolk.

Traditionally for char siu bao, ammonium bicarbonate is added to the dough, which results in the
typical 'smiling cracks' look at the top of the bun. If you don’t have access to ammonium, use
slightly more baking powder instead --- you’ll most likely not see the 'smiling cracks' but the
buns are equally tasty.

For cooking the bao, you have two options:

* Steaming them, seam side up, or
* Snow mountain bun style: Baking them, seam side down, with a cookie dough piped on top to give a sweet crunchy crust.

## Steps

1. Mix all the starter dough ingredients either by hand or by a mixer until a slightly wet dough is
formed. Cover the dough with a plastic wrap and let it rise for 4-6 hours or leave in the fridge
over night. The dough should at least double in size. If storing it in the fridge, bring the dough
back to room temperature before making the sweet dough.

2. Combine the starter dough with 80g of sugar in a stand mixer. Knead the dough until the sugar is
fully dissolved. You should notice that the dough is wetter and stickier.

3. Combine the cake flour, baking powder, ammonium if using in a bowl and sift to remove all the
crumbs. Add sifted flour mixture and water to the dough in batches. Knead the dough to incorporate
the dry and wet ingredients. When the dough forms a ball, add butter and let it knead for another 5
minutes or so. Once the dough is done, cover and let it rest for 20 minutes.

For cooking, choose between steaming them, or baking them ('snow mountain bun style'):

### Steaming

1. After filling, let the buns rest for 30 minutes and steam over high heat for 10 minutes. Once the
  heat is off, leave the lid on for additional 2 minutes before removing the lid and serving. These
  buns need to be served hot!

### Topping and baking

1. Beat butter and sugar at low speed until combined. Adjust to high speed and beat until mixture is
  light and fluffy. If using egg, gradually beat in the lightly whipped egg to avoid curdling.

1. Remove bowl, add the cake flour and mix well. If not using an egg, now add in the oil and stir
  with a spatula until well combined. Add to a piping bag, and refrigerate until needed. Before
  using, remove from the fridge for 5-10 minutes or until at room temperature.

1. Preheat the oven to 180ºC, and bake for 15 minutes until golden brown.

## Notes

If you decide to steam the buns with 'smiling cracks', you do not need to make nice folds as you
close the dough. Instead you just need to bring all sides together to enclose the bun. Make sure
you have a nice amount of dough on top. Otherwise, simply close the bun like you would a soup
dumpling.
