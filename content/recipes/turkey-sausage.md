A simple sausage recipe. Since turkey or beef mince can be quite lean, I like to mix in some animal
fat I have on-hand (usually chicken) to ensure I get a 70-30% meat-to-fat ratio.

## Ingredients

* Chicken fat (optional)
* 500g turkey mince (can also use beef mince)
* 2 tbsp fresh sage (finely chopped)
* 1 tbsp maple syrup
* 1 tsp fennel seed (crushed or ground)
* 1 clove garlic (grated)
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
* Freshly ground black pepper

## Steps

1. In a large bowl, add the mince and all other ingredients. Mix, with chopsticks or your hand
(or the paddle attachment of a stand mixer), until the fat and the meat has emulsified. It should
leave streaks on the sides of the bowl, and the mixture should feel 'springy'.

1. Leave in the fridge for up to 3 days before cooking, or freeze for use later.
