Sheng jian bao is the cousin of [[chicken xiao long bao | xiao long bao]]; like xiao long bao, it has a soupy, juicy
filling, however it is a pan fried yeasted bum rather than a steamed, unleavened dumpling.

The following recipe is adapted from [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/sheng-jian-bao-pan-fried-pork-soup-dumplings-recipe). I typically use
my [[lamb dumplings]] filling recipe as the filling, with a couple of tablespoons of stock or water
water added to ensure the filling is juicy after cooking.

## Ingredients

[[Component: lamb dumplings | filling | 0.5]]

* 5 tbsp water or stock

### Dough

* 200g plain flour
* 13g (1 tbsp) sugar
* 4g (1 tsp) yeast
* 125ml milk
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 tsp baking powder (optional)
* 15g (2 tbsp) cornflour (optional)

### To serve

* Sesame seeds
* Spring onion (finely diced)

## Steps

[[Component: lamb dumplings | filling]]

### Dough

1. In a large bowl, mix flour, cornflour, salt, sugar, baking powder, and yeast together. Warm milk
  in a microwave, about 30 seconds. Stir half of the milk into the flour, combine with a spatula,
  then stir in the remaining milk until thoroughly combined. Knead until dough comes together,
  about 5 to 10 seconds.

1. Transfer dough to a clean work surface and knead until the dough is
  smooth. Grease a bowl with oil, transfer the dough to the bowl, and cover with plastic wrapper.
  Let rest for 30-60 minutes, until doubled in size.

1. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Cut dough into 4 equal parts. Roll out one
  portion of dough into a 6-inch snake, and cut into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece of dough into
  a ball, flatten it with the palm of your hand, and roll the dough out with a small rolling pin
  until it is about 4 inches in diameter. 

### Assembly

1. Place about 1 tablespoon of the filling in the center of the dough round. Fold the dough up
  and around the filling, pleating and pinching around the top until sealed. 

1. Place finished buns on a lightly greased plate, cover plate loosely with plastic wrap, and let
  rest at room temperature for 10-15 minutes. The buns can be frozen at this point by spreading
  them on a parchment-lined baking sheet dusted with flour and freezing; transfer frozen buns to a
  zipper-lock bag for long-term freezer storage. 

1. To cook, heat 1 teaspoon oil in a non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Place
  the buns (fresh or frozen) in the pan, leaving 1/2 inch of space between each bun (work in
  batches if necessary). Pan-fry the buns until they start to turn lightly golden brown on the
  bottom, about 25 seconds.

1. Pour 1/4 cup water into the pan and cover immediately. Cook until
  the water completely evaporates, about 5 minutes if fresh and 7 minutes if frozen. Turn off the
  heat and leave the lid on the pan until the sizzling stops, about 30 seconds. Remove the lid,
  plate the buns, and serve immediately with spring onion and sesame seeds.
