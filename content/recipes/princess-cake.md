Princess cake (or Prinsesstårta) was a mainstay of my childhood. We would often pick up a few slices from a chain of Swedish bakeries in Perth called [Miss Maud](https://www.missmaud.com.au), and it was frequently chosen as a birthday cake by my grandmother (it being her favourite cake).

Below is a recipe adapted from the [New York Times](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1026740-princess-cake) for a homemade princess cake.

## Ingredients

[[Component: sponge cake]]

### Custard

* 2 large egg yolks
* 30g granulated sugar
* 15g cornflour
* 1 tsp vanilla paste
* 180ml milk
* 15g unsalted butter

### Marzipan

* 500 grams marzipan
* Icing sugar (for dusting)
* Green food coloring

### Mascarpone whipped cream

* 480ml cream
* 225g mascarpone
* 75g powdered sugar
* 2 tsp vanilla paste

### Assembly

* 150g raspberry jam

## Steps

[[Component: sponge cake]]

### Custard

1. While the cake bakes, make the custard: Whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, cornflour and
vanilla in a small saucepan until combined, followed by the milk.

1. Cook the custard over medium heat, whisking continuously, until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Once
boiling, turn the heat to low and whisk for 30 seconds longer. Turn off the heat, then whisk in the
butter. Pour into a heatproof container and press plastic wrap or parchment paper directly against
the custard to prevent it from forming a skin. Once cool to the touch, refrigerate to chill, at
least 1 hour.

### Marzipan

1. Once the cake and custard have cooled, prepare the marzipan coating and decoration. Dust your
work surface with powdered sugar, then knead the marzipan with one or two drops of green food
coloring until it is an even pale mint green. Add more powdered sugar whenever the marzipan is
sticky. If it feels dry or starts to crack, moisten your hands slightly (shaking off any excess
water) and knead until smooth. The marzipan should be pliable but not sticky throughout the
process. When you are happy with the color, form the marzipan into a 5 inch diameter disk.

1. Dust the smooth surface with powdered sugar. Roll out the marzipan disk, turning it a quarter way
around between each roll to maintain the circular shape, until 14 inches/36cm in diameter and 3mm
thick. As you work, dust the marzipan and surface with powdered sugar as needed to prevent
sticking. 

1. Roll the marzipan over your rolling pin, and unroll it over an ~9 inch diameter bowl, dusted side
down. Encourage the marzipan to take the form of the bowl by lifting it and gently pressing it into
place, ensuring that the marzipan overhangs the edges of the bowl by about 1 inch. If you need to
start again, you can simply remove the marzipan and re-roll it as before, adding more powdered
sugar if it's too sticky or dampening your hands if it's too dry. Once finished, cover the bowl
with a damp cloth to prevent the marzipan from being exposed to the air and drying out or
cracking.

### Mascarpone whipped cream

1. Whisk all the ingredients together using an electric hand mixer or stand mixer until very stiff
peaks form. This is the cement of your cake, so it needs to be stiff enough to provide structure.

### Finish the custard

1. To finish the custard, beat the cooled custard using an electric hand mixer or stand mixer until
smooth. Fold in 150g of the mascarpone cream until thick and airy. Refrigerate until ready to use.

### Assembly

1. Pile 2 cups (350g) of the remaining mascarpone cream into the marzipan-lined bowl, smoothing it
with a spoon or offset spatula. Spread an additional scant cup (125g) of cream evenly up and around
the walls of the marzipan, going all the way to the top.

1. Using a serrated knife, cut your spongecake evenly in half to form two rounds. Place the top
half, cut side up, over the cream into the bowl. Spread the raspberry jam on top of the cake,
followed by all of the custard, smoothing it all the way to the edges.

1. Place the remaining cake half, cut side down, onto the custard. Using the remaining 100g
mascarpone cream, fill in any gaps around the sides of the cake. If there aren't any, spread it all
over the top of the cake.

1. Trim the marzipan lining with scissors or a sharp knife so that there is an approximate 1/2-inch
border once it's folded up and over onto the cake. Lift and fold the marzipan onto the cake.

1. Place a serving platter upside down onto the cake and, gripping the bowl and plate at the same
time, confidently flip it over. Carefully lift the bowl off to reveal your princess cake. Use the
palms of your hands to gently pat the cake into shape, especially if you've used a bowl with an
angular base.

1. Use a dry pastry brush to dust off any excess powdered sugar, then wet the brush for a final
touch up, brushing to erase any last bits of dusty sugar. Refrigerate the cake for at least an hour
before serving.

## Notes

The princess cake can be refrigerated for up to four days. If you'd like, cover it with a cake dome
or overturned bowl.
