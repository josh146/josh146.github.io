A crumbly, delicate, savoury pastry --- the savoury version of [[Pâte sablée]]. Pâte brisée is also based on the concept of
sablage --- coating the flour with a fat, butter --- which results in a very short texture.

To scale this recipe up and down, simply remember the ratio 10:5:2:2 --- 10 parts flour, 5 parts butter,
2 parts water, and 2 parts egg yolks. For example, for a single tart shell, use 200g flour, 100g butter, 40ml water, and 1 egg yolk.

## Ingredients

* 500g plain flour
* 250g cold unsalted butter (in 1cm cubes)
* 100ml cold water
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp pepper
* 1/2 tsp additional spices and herbs
* 2 egg yolks (optional)

## Steps

1. **Sablage:** Using an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour, salt, pepper and butter on low speed for 2-3 minutes, until the
clumbs of butter are evenly dispersed and the mixture resembles bread crumbs.

2. Scrape down the bowl and add the egg yolks, cold water, and any additional spices and herbs (if using), and mix until well combined.

3. Transfer the pastry to a work surface and shape into a disc. Cover in plastic wrap and
refrigerate for at least 2 hours.

### Blind baking

1. Roll the dough out (ideally between two pieces of baking paper/silpats, to avoid needing to use
excessive flour) until about the size of the tart pan + an additional 3 cm.

2. Either use the silpat, a rolling pin, or the removable bottom of the tart pan to get the pastry into the pan.

3. Lifting the edges of the pastry, allow it to drop and push it into the corners of the tart
pan --- you can use a pastry brush to apply even pressure. Avoid stretching the pastry, as this can
result in excessive shrinkage during baking.

4. Run a knife around the tart shell to remove excess pastry. Dock the bottom of the pastry with a
fork, wrap with plastic wrap, and place in the fridge to chill for about 30 minutes to 1 hour.

5. Preheat the oven to 180-200ºC with rack set in middle position. Scrunch up a piece of baking paper
(aluminium foil also works, but tends to stick), and fill the tart evenly with baking beads, rice,
or dried beans.

6. Bake for 20 minutes, remove the baking beads, and bake for another 5 minutes until the pastry is
golden and dry to the touch.
