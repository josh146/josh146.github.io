## Ingredients

* 2 large egg whites
* 75g sugar
* pinch of salt
* a few drops vanilla extract

## Steps

1. To make the meringue, whisk together the egg whites, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand
mixer. Set the bowl over a pan of simmering water, and whisk it as it heats, checking it with an
instant-read thermometer.

1. Once it reaches 60ºC, transfer the bowl to the standing mixer and beat at high speed until cool,
scraping down the sides once of the mixer bowl, midway during mixing, and add the vanilla. Whip
until the meringue is light and fluffy.
