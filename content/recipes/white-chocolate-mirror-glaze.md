An easy mirror glaze recipe adapted from [Pastry Living](https://pastryliving.com/simple-chocolate-mirror-glaze-recipe/), this is the recipe I used for my rainbow mirror glaze cake.

## Ingredients

* 15g gelatin (bloom 225-230)
* 120g water
* 250g sugar
* 240g glucose (or light corn syrup)
* 150g sweetened condensed milk
* 15g unflavored gelatin (bloom 225-230)
* 60g ice cold water
* 275g white chocolate
* Food coloring (optional)

## Steps

### Mirror glaze

1. **Bloom the gelatin:** If using gelatin powder, sprinkle it in icy-cold water in a small bowl, mix well, and let it sit for about 10 minutes to let it hydrate completely. If using gelatin sheets, soak them in icy-cold water for about 10 minutes.

1. Add water, sugar, and corn syrup to a medium-small saucepan. Heat it at medium heat. Mix it with
a rubber spatula while heating, especially toward the end, to prevent the liquid from overfloating.
Remove from the heat once it reaches 103ºC (at this point the bubbles should be large and stay for
longer before popping).

1. Add sweetened condensed milk to the hot liquid and mix until combined. Add the bloomed gelatin
and mix well.

1. Pour the hot liquid over the white chocolate in a large bowl. Mix until combined. Using an
immersion blender at an angle, emulsify the chocolate mixture until smooth. Be careful not to lift it too while
blending it to prevent it from containing lots of air bubbles. Add food colouring if desired.

### Cake glazing

1. Ensure the glaze is between 30-35ºC (33ºC is usually ideal). If you have just made the glaze,
wait for it to cool to this range (it should take about 2 hours). If you are using refrigerated glaze, heat it up in the microwave
and let it cool down.

1. Set a wire rack on top of a baking sheet lined with cling film or baking paper. Remove the frozen
cake from a silicone mold or cake ring and ensure that it is completely frozen --- place the cake
on the wire rack.

1. Immediately pour a generous amount of the glaze on top of the cake in a circular motion so you
can coat the sides of the cake all around. Next, immediately stroke the surface of the cake lightly
with an offset spatula to drop excess glaze and make it thinner. Move the spatula parallel to the
cake to create an even layer.

1. Wait until the glaze is no longer dripping, then
insert an offset spatula under the bottom of the cake and move it in a circular motion to cut off the dripped glaze. Transfer the cake onto a plate or cake board.

## Notes

* Pour the glaze into an airtight container. You can store it in the fridge (for a week) or the
  freezer (for a few months) To use, simply heat it in the microwave or a bain-marie.

* To store a glazed cake, you can leave it out on the counter if the room temperature is 22ºC.
  Otherwise, keep it refrigerated (but no need to cover the cake, the glaze acts as a natural
  covering).
