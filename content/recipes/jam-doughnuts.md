An easy, yeasted, and super light jam doughnut, that can be made in a single day (or a single morning, afternoon, or evening). Based off a recipe from [Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/jam-filled-challah-doughnuts).

## Ingredients

### Dough

* 120ml warm water
* 8g instant yeast
* 65g sugar
* 5 large egg yolks
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 320g all-purpose flour
* 85g unsalted butter (room temperature)

### Frying and assembly

* ~3L vegetable oil
* caster sugar
* ~300g seedless jam

## Steps

### Dough

1. Mix yeast, warm water, egg yolks, salt, and sugar in a bowl of a stand mixer. Using the
dough hook, beat on medium-low until mixture is combined.

2. Add the flour on medium speed and mix until combined and thick, about 3 minutes.

3. With the mixer on low speed, add butter a piece at a time, mixing until incorporated after each
addition. Once all the butter has been added, mix until the dough is smooth, shiny and elastic
(about 5 minutes). The dough should be tacky but not sticky.[ref]More flour may need to be added if the dough is still sticky after mixing in the butter.[/ref]

4. Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and knead for a few minutes by hand. Place dough in a
lightly oiled large bowl, cover loosely, and leave to rise in a warm spot until doubled in size,
about 1 hour.

5. Punch down dough and roll or pat out on a lightly floured surface to about 0.5" thick. Punch out
rounds of dough with a 2" cutter and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing 1" apart.
Reroll scraps once and cut out more rounds. Cover doughnuts loosely with plastic wrap and let rise
until not quite doubled in size, 30–60 minutes.

### Frying and assembly

1. Fit a large heavy saucepan with thermometer; pour in oil to come 3" up sides and heat over
medium-high until thermometer registers 340ºF/170ºC.

2. Working in batches and adjusting heat to maintain oil temperature, fry doughnuts, turning once,
until golden brown, about 1 minute 30 seconds per side. Transfer to a paper towel–lined baking
sheet; let cool slightly.

3. Place sugar
in a medium bowl, and working in batches, toss doughnuts to coat. Transfer back to baking sheet.

4. Stir jam to loosen and spoon into pastry bag fitted with tip (or use a squeeze bottle). Working
one at a time, poke a small hole into side of doughnuts (a chopstick works great) and gently pipe
in a generous amount of jam.

## Notes

Doughnuts are best enjoyed on the day, but can be kept in an airtight container at room
temperature for 2-3 days. Microwave the doughnuts for 10 seconds or so.
