I love an extra tart lemon or lime tart, so I lean towards curd-based citrus tarts (which are more sour, but less smooth in texture than a custard-based tart). This is an adaption of [David Lebovitz's lime meringue tart recipe](https://www.davidlebovitz.com/lime-meringue-tart/), with the main difference being a slight reduction in the amount of sugar.

## Ingredients

* 1 blind-baked [[Pâte Sablée]] tart shell.

[[Component: lime curd]]

[[Component: swiss meringue]]

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 180ºC.

[[Component: lime curd]]

1. Pour the curd into the pre-baked tart shell, and bake for 10 minutes.

[[Component: swiss meringue]]

### Topping the tart

1. Scrape the meringue into a pasty bag fitted with a star tip and pipe a ring around the perimeter
of the tart. Or spread across the tart with a spatula.

1. Using a kitchen torch, torch the top of the meringue until caramelized.

## Notes

The tart is best eaten the day it is made. You can refrigerate any leftovers. If you wish to make
the lime filling in advance, you can make it and store it in the refrigerator for up to five days.
