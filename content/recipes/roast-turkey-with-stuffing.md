Growing up, we would always roast a turkey for Christmas day lunch (typically one of the hottest
days of the year in Perth, frequently over 40°C). I've tried **so many ways** to roast a whole
turkey and keep the breast meat moist --- dry brine, wet brine, butter under the skin, tray of
water in the oven, etc. --- and except for one year (where I didn't put in any effort so have no
idea what went right), I was never satisfied.

Deciding to spatchcock the turkey was a gamechanger. Not only was the breast meat perfectly juicy,
everything was just **so much easier**. It roasted much faster, I could make the gravy ahead of
time, and there was actually room in the oven for roast potatoes at the same time --- no need to
swelter in the heat cooking the vegetables on the BBQ while the turkey was in the oven.

The recipe below is an amalgamation of a few recipes:

- The turkey and gravy recipe is adapted from [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/butterfiled-roast-turkey-with-gravy-recipe).

- The stuffing is a recipe from my grandmother, with the addition of [[hainanese chicken rice | chicken rice ginger sauce ]] coming from my mum (her favourite umami bomb).

Spatchcocking the turkey lead to a dilemma, where do we put the stuffing? It came out perfectly
delicious simply placing it underneath the spatchcocked turkey.

## Ingredients

* 1 whole turkey
* Salt (1.25% of the weight of the turkey)
* 120 g unsalted butter
* Thyme (chopped)
* Sage (chopped)
* Lemon or orange zest

### Stuffing

* 1 onion (finely diced)
* 2 sticks celery (finely diced)
* 2 garlic cloves (minced)
* 1 tbsp chicken rice ginger
* 1 lemon
* Parsley
* Thyme
* Rosemary
* Bread crumbs
* Olive oil

### Gravy and turkey stock

* 1 carrot (cut into 2 inch pieces)
* 1 celery (cut into 2 inch pieces)
* 1 onion (cut into quarters)
* 2 bay leaves
* 3-4 thyme sprigs
* 45g unsalted butter (about 3 tbsp)
* 30g flour (about 4 tbsp)
* 1L homemade [[chicken stock]] or store bought low-sodium chicken or turkey stock (optional)
* Wine (optional)

## Instructions

### Dry brine the turkey

1. Cut the backbone out of the turkey. Flip it around, and press down on the breastbone to flatten
the turkey. Cut off the wingtips, and save this with the backbone for the turkey stock.

2. Place the turkey in a baking tray, dry it with paper towels, and cover evenly with the salt ---
including underneath. Leave uncovered in the fridge for 24-48 hours.

3. Soften the butter, and mix in the chopped thyme, sage, lemon or orange zest, and black pepper.
Rub the herb butter all over the turkey and under the skin. At this point, you can continue on and
roast the turkey that day, or leave it overnight uncovered in the fridge to roast the next morning.

### Turkey stock

1. Cut the backbone into 2 inch sections. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a roughly 3L saucepan over
high heat, and add the chopped turkey parts (backbone, wingtips, and other parts you might have),
stirring occasionally until browned (5 minutes). 

2. Add onions, carrots, and celery, and cook until softened (another 5 minutes).

3. Add chicken or turkey stock, thyme, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and reduce to a bare simmer.
Allow to cook 45 minutes, then strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a 2L liquid measuring cup
and discard solids. Skim off any fat from the surface of the broth and keep in the fridge.

### Prepare the stuffing

1. Use a food processor to coarsely blend the stale bread.

2. Gently fry the onion, celery, garlic cloves, and chicken rice ginger, in olive oil until soft and
golden brown.

3. Add the fried onion and celery to the breadcrumb mixture, alongside parsley, rosemary, thyme,
salt, pepper, olive oil, and a squeeze of lemon/lemon zest to taste.

### Roasting the turkey

1. Preheat the oven to 230°C.

2. Place the stuffing in a baking tray, and place a wire rack directly on top of the stuffing with
the turkey on top. Optionally, poor a little water, stock, or white wine into the baking tray to stop the
stuffing and drippings from burning.

3. Transfer turkey to oven and roast, rotating occasionally, until an instant read thermometer
inserted into the deepest part of the breast registers 150°F (66°C), and the thighs register at
least 165°F (74°C), about 60-80 minutes depending on the size of the turkey. As a rough rule of
thumb, 10 minutes per 500g.

4. When turkey is cooked, remove from oven and transfer rack to a new baking sheet, and move the
stuffing to a separate serving bowl. Allow the turkey to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes
before carving --- do not use foil, this will cause the skin to go soggy!

### Gravy

1. While the turkey is resting, make the gravy. Melt butter over medium-high heat in a 2L
saucepan. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly until flour is golden brown, about 3 minutes.

2. Whisking constantly, add broth in a thin, steady stream until it is all incorporated (you can
optionally add some wine as well). Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until reduced to
about 1L, about 20 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt, pepper and MSG, cover, and keep gravy
warm.

3. Carefully pour any collected juices from out of the roasting pan through a fine-mesh strainer
into a liquid measuring cup[ref]There might not be much --- the stuffing would have soaked up a
lot.[/ref]. Skim off excess fat and discard. Whisk juices into gravy. 

## Notes

If you would like to roast the turkey whole, go for it! Simply follow the steps as is, but place the
stuffing *inside* the turkey. Cover the turkey with foil, and place in the oven on the top rack
(with a tray of water below to add moisture and stop the turkey from dying out).

The turkey should require approximate 20-25 minutes per 500g, working out to about 4 hours for a
5.2kg turkey. Every hour or so, take the turkey out and baste it with the pan drippings. If the
drippings start drying out, add a bit of stock to the pan. For the last 40-45 minutes, remove the
foil and the baking tray of water to crisp up the skin (can also turn up the temperature to
200°C).
