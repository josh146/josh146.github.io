While waiting for my PhD examination to be complete, I was essentially doing three things: teaching
at my university, going slightly crazy, and hyperfixated on making the perfect xiao long bao at
home.

This is the recipe I ended up with; it is a hybrid adaptation of the [Bon Appetit recipe]
(https://youtu.be/iMYRjp4h0y0) and the [Chef Steps recipe](https://youtu.be/bAaAf_T-ygY), modified
to use chicken rather than pork.

I've included two variations on the gelatinous soup stock; a traditional version and an easier
version where powdered gelatin is added to pre-made or store bought chicken stock.

## Ingredients

### Soup (traditional)

* 225g chicken feet
* 500g chicken bones
* 3 spring onions (cut into 1-inch pieces)
* 3 inch ginger (cut into 1-inch pieces, smashed)
* 2 tbsp Shaoxing wine

### Soup (easier, with gelatin)

* 500ml reduced-salt [[chicken stock]]
* 3 spring onions (cut into 1-inch pieces)
* 3 inch ginger (cut into 1-inch pieces, smashed)
* 3 tsp gelatin powder
* 1 tbsp Shaoxing wine

### Filling

* 500g ground meat (20% fat or more)[ref]If I am working with a lean ground meat like chicken or turkey, I like to add some chicken fat/schmaltz that I have on hand to get the percentage up to 20% fat.[/ref]
* 3 spring onions (finely chopped)
* 1 garlic clove (grated)
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp Shaoxing wine
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 tsp toasted sesame oil
* 1 tsp ginger (grated)
* 1 tsp white pepper

### Dipping Sauce

* 2 spring onions (thinly sliced)
* 2-inch ginger (thinly sliced)
* 80ml (1/3 cup) black vinegar
* 2 tbsp soy sauce

## Steps

### Soup (traditional)

1. Place chicken bones and feet in a small stockpot or large saucepan and add cold water to cover.
Bring to a boil; drain and rinse with cold water. Return chicken to the saucepan and add sping
onions, ginger, wine, and about 2L of cold water.

2. Bring to a boil, skim surface of any foam, and reduce heat. Simmer, skimming often, until liquid
is almost opaque and reduced to 500 ml, 3 hours. Season with salt, and strain into a 13x9"
baking dish; discard solids[ref]This can also be made in a pressure cooker at high pressure for 90 minutes.[/ref]. Chill until set, at least 2 hours and up to 3 days. If making ahead,
cover soup with plastic wrap once jelled.

### Soup (easier, with gelatin)

1. Put the stock, wine, meat, green onion, and ginger in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook,
uncovered, for about eight minutes, or until the stock has reduced by half. You should end up with
around 250ml. Strain the soup, discard the solids, and set aside to cool and concentrate for 15
minutes.

1. Return the stock to the saucepan and sprinkle in the gelatin. Heat over medium-high heat,
stirring the soup until the gelatin dissolves. Bring the stock to a simmer and then turn off the
heat. Pour it into an 8 in by 8 in (20 cm by 20 cm) baking pan to make a thin layer that will cool
quickly and be easy to cut up.

### Filling

1. Mix ground meat, spring onions, garlic, soy sauce, salt, wine, sugar, oil, ginger, and pepper
with chopsticks in a medium bowl, stirring in one direction until it all comes together and a light
film forms on the sides of bowl, about 20 seconds. Cut a fine crosshatch pattern in jelled soup to
create very small pieces (about 3mm squares). Scrape into bowl with filling and mix to combine.
Cover and chill until ready to use.

[[Component: dumpling wrappers]]

### Dipping sauce

1. Mix spring onion, ginger, vinegar, and soy sauce in a small bowl; set aside. 

### Assembly

1. Lay a wrapper across the upper part of your palm and bottom half of the fingers of your
nondominant hand. Spoon 1 tbsp filling into wrapper, making sure to get some pieces of jelled soup.
Spoon a couple more pieces of jelled soup into center of filling.

2. Slightly cup your palm around dumpling and gently grasp edge of wrapper between your thumb and
index finger. Position your other thumb and index finger half an inch away in the same fashion.
Using fingertips on one hand, gently pull and stretch wrapper outward before bringing it in to meet
opposite fingers. Carefully fold stretched area in on itself, creating a pleat. Pinch to seal.
Rotating dumpling as you work, repeat process to create a series of 18 pleats, leaving a small hole
in the center. Cradle dumpling in your palm, gently rotating it and working filling upward so
dumpling is shaped like a fig. This step elongates the dumpling, eliminating air between wrapper
and filling. Pinch edges together and gently twist to seal. 

3. Place dumpling in lightly greased baking tray and cover with plastic wrap. Repeat with remaining
wrappers and filling.

### Steaming

1. Place dumplings in a steamer over a large saucepan of rapidly boiling water, making sure water
doesn’t touch steamer, and cover. Steam dumplings 8 minutes (10 if frozen). Serve directly from
steamer with dipping sauce.

## Notes

Once the dumplings are filled, they freeze easily. Simply place the greased baking tray with the
folded dumplings in the freezer. Once semi-frozen, move them to a ziplock bag, squeeze out the air,
and place back in the freezer. Dumplings can be cooked straight from frozen.
