### Lamb

* 3/4 cup (180ml) canola oil
* 4 medium cloves garlic (finely minced)
* 8-12 dried chilies (coarsely ground)
* 2 tbsp cumin seeds (toasted and coarsely ground)
* 1 tbsp Sichuan peppercorns (coarsely ground)
* 1/4 tsp white pepper
* 1/3 cup (80ml) dark soy sauce

### To serve

## Instructions

### Broth

1. Sprinkle lamb evenly on all sides with salt and place on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet.
Let stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.

1. In a pressure cooker set to sauté mode, or a dutch oven over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon
(15ml) oil until smoking. Working in batches, brown lamb on all sides, about 8 minutes; transfer to
a heatproof bowl. Pour off fat in pressure cooker into a heatproof bowl and reserve.

1. Return cooker to heat (or sauté mode), stir in the Shaoxing wine, and cook, scraping up any
browned bits with wooden spoon, until alcohol has cooked off, about 30 seconds. Stir in chicken
stock and water. Return lamb to pot along with any accumulated juices.

    * **Pressure cook:** Lock pressure-cooker lid in place and bring to high pressure over high heat.
    Once cooker has reached high pressure, cook for 40 minutes. When done, depressurize the cooker, and
    carefully remove the lid, allowing steam to escape away from you.
    
    * **Slow cook:** Bring the dutch oven to a boil, and then turn it down to a simmer. Put the lid
    on (with a small gap for excess steam to escape), and cook for a minimum of 2-3 hours, until lamb
    is fork tender, and broth is rich and fatty.

1. Strain broth through fine-mesh strainer into clean heatproof container, pressing on solids to
extract as much liquid as possible; transfer lamb to work surface. When lamb is cool enough to
handle, separate meat from bones, discarding bones.

1. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil in now-empty pressure cooker/dutch oven over medium heat
(or using an electric cooker's sauté mode) until shimmering. Add spring onions, garlic, ginger, and
star anise and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in strained broth, bring to boil, and
simmer until fragrant, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt.

### Lamb

1. Meanwhile, add oil, reserved lamb fat, and minced garlic to medium saucepan set over medium-high
heat and cook until garlic is fragrant and just beginning to brown, 3 to 5 minutes.

1. Remove from heat and stir in chilies, cumin, Sichuan peppercorn, and white pepper. Let mixture
cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Whisk in dark soy sauce and sugar. Gently stir in reserved lamb
meat until lightly shredded and incorporated. Season with salt.

### To serve

1. Using a slotted spoon, remove and discard spring onions, garlic, ginger, and star anise pods from broth.

1. Bring large pot of unsalted water to boil over high heat. If making your own hand-pulled noodles,
prepare them now; otherwise, proceed with cooking store-bought noodles. Place in pot of boiling
water, stirring gently with chopsticks or tongs to prevent sticking. Add about 360ml hot broth to serving bowls.

1. When noodles are cooked, drain thoroughly with fine-mesh strainer or noodle basket, shaking off
as much excess water as possible, then place noodles in each bowl of hot broth. Stir noodles with
chopsticks or tongs, then lift and fold noodles over. Spoon 1/2 cup shredded lamb mixture with some
of its sauce over noodles. Sprinkle with sliced spring onions and coriander. Serve immediately.
