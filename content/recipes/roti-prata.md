Roti prata is a delicious flaky flatbread of south Indian origin found in Singapore and Malaysia
(where it is called roti canai), often served alongside [[chicken curry|chicken]] or [[fish head curry | fish curry]] sauce.

Growing we would often head out to a 24 hour mamak stall (such as [Al-Ameen](https://www.ameenmakanhouse.com/) on Bukit Timah) to have roti prata (served with sugar and curry)
for breakfast (where my dad would always make sure to ask for the prata to be 'goreng goreng').

## Ingredients

* 250ml vegetable oil (1 cup)
* 125g ghee or clarified butter, melted
* 500g bread flour (aim for flour with 11% protein)
* 60ml milk, plus extra if necessary (1/4 cup)
* 1 egg, lightly beaten
* 1 tbsp caster sugar, or to taste
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. For dough, combine ingredients and 180ml water in a mix until a soft, sticky dough forms. Add a
little more milk (10ml) if needed. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead
until smooth, elastic and shiny (8-10 minutes). Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a
damp tea towel and set aside to rest for 20 minutes.

1. Roll dough into a 6 cm-diameter cylinder, then cut into 12 even pieces and roll into balls.

1. Pour oil into a bowl and add the balls of dough, turning each to coat well, then cover bowl with
plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature to rest (at least 1 hour or overnight).

1. Melt the ghee and have it available in a small bowl. Press down each ball to a 20cm round on a
lightly oiled work surface. Carefully stretch dough in a circular motion with lightly greased hands
until very thin, pulling gently from underneath as you go.

1. When the dough is wafer-thin, dab lightly all over with melted ghee. Fold the left edge over two
thirds of the way, and then fold over the right edge in a letter fold. Make sure to trap air under
the folds. From here, you have two options[ref]From what I remember, square seems more common in Malaysia, whereas spiral seems more common in Singapore.[/ref]:

   - Spiral: Carefully scrunch up the long edges to meet in the center – you should have a long ‘rope’
of dough. Finally, twist the dough in a spiral, tucking the end of the dough underneath. Leave the
spirals to rest for 30 minutes.

   - Square: Fold down the top edges until you have a flat square. With the square shape, the dough is
fried as-is and there is no need to rest it. 

1. Heat a little ghee on a flat grill or frying pan over medium-high heat. If the prata are in spirals,
make sure to flatten them out with your palm. Add prata and cook until golden and crisp (1-2 minutes
each side). Repeat with remaining prata and ghee. 

1. Before serving, make sure to quickly 'clap' each prata: with the prata flat on a plate or on the
table, place your hands against two opposite edges and bring them together quickly. Rotate the
prata 90 degrees and repeat.[ref]Clapping the prata helps separate and break the flaky layers, releasing trapped steam and ensuring the prata stays crispy for longer.[/ref]
