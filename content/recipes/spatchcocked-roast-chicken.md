1. Apply the marinade to the chicken on both sides. Place in the fridge for a minimum of 1 hour, but preferably overnight[ref]If the marinade is acidic --- e.g., it contains lemon juice or yogurt, try to avoid marinating for more than 5 hours.[/ref], to marinate and brine.

1. Preheat the oven to 200ºC. Roast the chicken for 55-60 minutes, rest for 10-15 minutes, and then carve and serve.
