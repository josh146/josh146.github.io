A fun, rainbow-inspired mirror glazed vanilla sponge cake that I made for my cousins 10th birthday.

## Ingredients

* 4-5 coloured [[sponge cake]] layers (9 inches or 23 cm in diameter)
* [[White chocolate mirror glaze]]
* Assorted gel food colouring
* 250g unsalted butter (at about 18ºC)
* 300g icing sugar
* 2 tbsp milk or cream
* 2 tsp vanilla paste

## Steps

1. Prepare the [[sponge cake]] layers --- add the food colouring to the egg yolk mixture before beating and folding in the egg whites.

1. Make the American butter cream, by beating (in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment or with a hand mixer) the butter, icing sugar, vanilla, and milk or cream, until fluffy and combined. Stack the coloured sponge cake layers, icing between the layers with butter cream. When done, use a bread knife to level the outside of the cake, and frost as smoothly as possible with buttercream, before leaving it in the fridge to chill thoroughly.

1. Separate the white chocolate mirror glaze into 4-5 separate bowls (one of them being a large jug), and dye them different colours using food dye. Note that the colour of the glaze in the jug will be your 'base' colour. Carefully pour each coloured mirror glaze into the center of the jug --- you should have concentric circles of colours in the jug.

## Notes

* To store the glazed cake, you can leave it out on the counter if the room temperature is 22ºC.
  Otherwise, keep it refrigerated (but no need to cover the cake, the glaze acts as a natural
  covering).

* If you would like, you can half the sponge cake mixture to bake half layers. This will result in a shorter cake.
