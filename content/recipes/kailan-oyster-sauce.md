## Ingredients

* 1 packet of kailan (about 300g)
* 2 tbsp neutral oil
* 1 tsp minced garlic (or chicken rice ginger)
* 2 tbsp Shaoxing wine
* 1 tbsp oyster sauce
* 1 tsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 tsp cornflour
* 100ml chicken stock or water
* 1 tsp sesame oil

## Steps

1. To prepare the kailan, cut off the roots and discard. Cut the kailan in half, separating the
stalks from the leafy tops. Further chop the stalks in half, and wash these first until cleaned.
Chop the leafy tops in half, and wash these next until cleaned.

1. In a bowl combine together the Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, cornflour, and chicken stock or water. Set aside.

1. In a wok add oil then sauté garlic.

1. Add the kailan stems and a tablespoon of water and leave to fry and steam for 1-2 minutes with
the lid on. Once tender, add the leafy tops and stir fry until they just begin to wilt.

1. Pour the sauce and continue to stir fry until the vegetables are just tender but still bright
green, and the sauce has thickened.

1. Stir in sesame oil, turn heat off then serve.
