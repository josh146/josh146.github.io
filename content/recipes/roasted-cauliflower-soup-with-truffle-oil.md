A truffle-oil infused roasted cauliflower soup recipe that my mum used to make for us growing up ---
with the recipe coming from [Pukara Estate](https://pukaraestate.com.au/blogs/recipes/roasted-cauliflower-soup-with-truffle-evoo), a local
producer of olive oils here in Western Australia.

I like to sometimes also include some chickpeas in the soup, reserving some of the roasted chickpeas and cauliflower to garnish on top.

## Ingredients

* 1 whole cauliflower
* 1 bay leaf
* 1L chicken or vegetable stock
* 5 sprigs of thyme
* 1 cup cream
* 4 tbsp truffle flavoured olive oil, plus extra for serving
* 1 brown onion (roughly chopped)
* 1 leek (roughly chopped)
* 3 cloves garlic (roughly chopped)
* 1 medium potato (quartered)
* 1 tbsp butter
* pinch of nutmeg
* Chopped parsley or chives for serving

## Instructions

1. Pre-heat oven to 200ºC. Slice the cauliflower florets into smaller pieces, place in a large roasting tin and coat with 3 tablespoons of Truffle oil. Sprinkle with chopped thyme leaves, season and roast for 25 minutes or until just turning golden.

2. Meanwhile, in a large soup pot place the remaining truffle oil, butter and heat gently. Add the
chopped leek, onion and garlic. Fry until soft and then add potato and cook for a further 5
minutes, stirring occasionally.

3. Add stock, bay leaf and simmer gently. Add cauliflower once ready (reserving some florets for garnishing) and keep simmering for a
further 20 minutes.

4. Remove bay leaf and use a stick blender to blend until it reaches a smooth consistency. Be
careful, as it will splash back. Add the cream, nutmeg, season to taste and reduce for a further 5
minutes.

5. Serve into bowls, top with chopped herbs, reserved roasted cauliflower florets, and a good drizzle of truffle oil.
