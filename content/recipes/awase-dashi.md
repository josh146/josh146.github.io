## Ingredients

* 10g katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes)
* 10g kombu (dried kelp)

### Optional

* 30g niboshi (dried sardines, heads and guts removed)
* 2-3 dried shiitake mushrooms

## Steps

1. Add 1L of water to a medium saucepan, and add the kombu (and, optionally, the niboshi and dried mushrooms). Over medium heat, bring to a bare simmer. Remove from the heat and add the katsuobushi --- let stand with the lid on for 10 minutes.

2. Strain through a fine mesh strainer.

## Notes

* You can re-use the kombu and katsuobushi to make a second dashi (niban dashi, as opposed to the ichiban dashi or first dashi), which can be used as a building block in soups where clarity is less important (e.g., miso soup), stews, glazes, or sauces.

    To do so, take the used kombo and bonito flakes and add to 1L of water. Simmer for 5-10 minutes, and then strain.

* Dashi can be stored in the fridge for one week.

* The used kombu and katsuobushi can be stored in the refrigerator for a week or in the freezer for
  up to a month.
