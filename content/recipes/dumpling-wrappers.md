## Ingredients

* 240g bread flour
* 120g plain flour
* 200ml water (boiled)
* 3 tsp canola oil

## Steps

1. While boiling water for the dough, combine the two flours in a mixing bowl. Combine the
just-boiled water and the oil in a separate bowl.

1. While mixing with chopsticks, add the water-and-oil mixture to the flour. The result will be a
soft, warm dough. If the dough is too dry, add water by the half-teaspoon to soften. Gather the
dough into a ball and transfer it to a very lightly floured work surface. Knead it for about five
minutes.

1. When you’re done kneading, the dough should be smooth and a little bit elastic. Test it by
pressing a finger into the dough. It should bounce back moderately quickly and leave a shallow
indentation. Place the dough in a ziplock-style bag and seal it well, pushing out all of the excess
air as you close the bag. Let the dough rest at room temperature for an hour before using. You can
refrigerate the dough overnight as long as you bring it back to room temperature before moving
forward.

1. Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time and keeping other pieces covered
with plastic wrap, roll out dough with your palms to make 12 inch-long ropes.

1. Cut each rope into twelve 1 inch-pieces with bench scraper. Using a ruler as a guide means all
your pieces will be the same size, resulting in uniform dumplings.

1. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time and keeping other pieces covered in plastic wrap, roll
until round, and then press down with your palm to make a disc.

1. Use dowel to roll out into thin rounds---work from the center moving outward, applying slightly
more pressure as you reach the edges to make them a little thinner. Cover with plastic.
