## Ingredients

* 625g frozen or fresh raspberries
* 250ml water (include the frozen raspberry water)
* 300g sugar
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 2 tbsp lime or lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Add water and raspberries to a food processor. Pulse until mixture has a smooth consistency.

2. Place a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl. Add pureed raspberries to the strainer and press
with the back of a large spoon or a rubber spatula through the strainer to remove the seeds. Repeat
with remaining raspberry puree. Discard anything left in the strainer.

3. Add sugar, vanilla, and lemon juice to the raspberry juice in the bowl. Whisk until sugar is
dissolved.

4. Freeze according to your ice cream maker's instructions. Serve immediately for a soft-serve
dessert or transfer to a shallow container and freeze an additional 1-2 hours for a more firm
sorbet.
