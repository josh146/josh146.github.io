Theme: Kake soba with prawn tempura
noodles: soba
garnish_list: 4 onsen eggs; 2 tbsp dried wakame seaweed; 8 slices of fried fishcake (satsumaage)
topping_list: 4 tiger prawns; 120g plain flour; 1 egg; 200ml ice water; cornflour or potato starch
topping_step: To make the prawn tempura, fill a saucepan with about 3cm of neutral oil, and bring it to 170ºC. Whisk together the egg and ice water, and slowly stream it into the flour, mixing with chopsticks (avoid mixing too vigorously to avoid gluten development; it's fine for some lumps to remain). Dust the prawns with cornflour or potato starch, dip in the batter, and deep fry for 2 minutes until golden brown.

Theme: Miso poached chicken soba
noodles: soba
garnish_list: Sesame oil
topping_list: 2-3 tbsp white miso; 4 chicken thighs (boneless, skin-on); 1 tbsp soy sauce; 1 tbsp sesame oil
topping_step: Bring the soup broth to a light simmer, turn the heat down to low, and place in the chicken thighs to lightly poach for 20 minutes. Remove the chicken thighs, and using a strain mix the miso into the soup broth. Then, using a hot cast iron or stainless steel pan, sear the chicken thighs skin-side down for 1 minute until the skin is golden brown and crispy. Mix the soy sauce and sesame oil, brush over the chicken skin, and slice.
