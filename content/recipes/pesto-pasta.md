A quick and fresh dinner or lunch, I love this pasta (and it's a great way to get a serving of greens). I typically serve it topped with an onsen eggs (or two) for protein, alongside some crumbled feta.

## Ingredients

* 400g pasta of choice
* Onsen egg (optional)
* Feta cheese
* Toasted pine nuts
* Parmigiano reggiano (grated)

2. Boil the pasta as per package directions. When done, strain, reserving some pasta water.

3. In the same saucepan used to boil the pasta, add the pasta as well as 4 tbsp of pesto. Add a
splash (apprximately 1/4 cup) of pasta water, and agitate the pasta until it forms an emulsified,
creamy sauce that coats the pasta.

4. Serve, topping with an onsen egg, toasted pine nuts, parmigiano, and crumbled feta cheese.

## Notes

This pasta does not reheat well, so for meal prep I prefer to keep the pesto in the fridge, and boil pasta for each meal.
