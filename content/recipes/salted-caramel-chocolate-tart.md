## Ingredients

* 1 blind-baked [[Pâte Sablée]] tart shell, with 60g of flour swapped for cocoa powder.

### Filling

* 300g sugar
* 1/8 tsp cream of tartar
* 85g unsalted butter (chilled, cut into pieces)
* 80ml heavy cream
* 1 tsp kosher salt

### Ganache

* 115g semisweet chocolate (finely chopped)
* 120ml heavy cream
* 30g unsalted butter (cut into small pieces)
* Flaky sea salt

## Method

### Filling

1. Bring sugar, cream of tartar, and 80 ml water to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-low,
stirring with a heatproof spatula until dissolved. Cook, swirling pot often but not stirring, until
mixture turns deep amber and wisps of smoke rise from the surface, 8–10 minutes. Remove caramel
from heat and immediately stir in butter a piece at a time until smooth (be careful; mixture will
sputter). Gradually stir in cream, then add salt. Transfer caramel to a heatproof measuring glass
(you should have about 375ml). Let cool until warm.[ref]Caramel filling can be made 3 days ahead, simply cover and chill. When ready to pour, microwave in 20-second
intervals, stirring in between, until just pourable.[/ref]

2. Pour caramel into cooled tart shell. Chill until caramel is set, at least 1 hour.

### Ganache

1. Place chocolate, cream, and butter in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Stir with a heatproof spatula until ganache is smooth, about 5
minutes. Let cool until thickened enough to hold an indentation from a spoon—if it’s too warm,
it won’t hold its swirls.

2. Remove tart from refrigerator and scrape ganache over caramel. Using a spoon, gently work
ganache over surface, creating decorative swooshes and swirls. Sprinkle with sea salt; let sit until
ganache has lost its sheen, 10–15 minutes.
