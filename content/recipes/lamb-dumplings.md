My favourite dumpling restaurant in Perth, [Mom Dumpling House](https://www.momdumplinghouse.com/), is renowned for their north-eastern Chinese dumplings. After moving to Toronto, I began to miss this style of dumpling (Cantonese-style dumplings are much more common there!).

This is my attempt to recreate their lamb dumplings.

## Ingredients

### Filling

* 1kg ground lamb
* 1 bunch green onions (finely diced)
* 5-8 leaves wombok (finely diced)
* 1 egg
* 4 tbsp Shaoxing wine
* 4 tbsp light soy sauce
* 1 tbsp dark soy sauce
* 2 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 tbsp ginger (minced)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp white pepper
* 1 tsp garam masala
* 1 tsp cumin

[[Component: dumpling wrappers]]

## Instructions

### Filling

1. Combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl, mixing thoroughly with your hands or a wooden
spoon. Let the filling rest for thirty minutes before using to fully allow the meat to develop its
flavors. The filling may also be kept in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours, or frozen
indefinitely.

### Fill and cook

1. Lay a wrapper across the upper part of your palm and bottom half of the fingers of your
nondominant hand. Spoon 1 tbsp filling into wrapper, and fold. Once folded, placed on a lightly greased baking tray and cover with plastic wrap.

1. Steam the dumplings for 7 to 9 minutes over medium-high heat, until the skins are
semi-translucent. Serve immediately with black vinegar and chili sauce or oil on the side.

## Notes

Once the dumplings are filled, they freeze easily. Simply place the greased baking tray with the folded dumplings in the freezer. Once semi-frozen, move them to a ziplock bag, squeeze out the air, and place back in the freezer.

Dumplings can be cooked from frozen, with no difference in timings.
