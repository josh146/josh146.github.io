An easy sourdough sandwich loaf recipe that is minimally enriched, and doable in one day from
sourdough starter discard. This loaf produces bread perfect for toast, sandwiches, and more.

## Ingredients

* 190g tangzhong
* 295g bread flour
* 80g whole wheat flour
* 32g olive oil
* 20g honey
* 185g water
* 20g salt
* 100g levain or mature starter

### Tangzhong

* 150g milk
* 40g bread flour

### Night-before levain

This levain will take about 10 hours to mature at room temperatures (22-24ºC).

* 8g mature starter
* 80g bread flour
* 80g water

## Steps

### Levain

1. The night before, make the levain; adjust the amount of sourdough starter and the ambient
temperature of the levain as needed. You can also choose to forgo the levain and use mature
sourdough starter the next morning.

### Mix

1. In a medium saucepan, mix the milk and flour and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly,
until the tangzhong thickens. Pour onto a place in a thin layer, and place in the fridge or freezer
to cool down.

1. In the bowl of a stand mixer, add all the ingredients and mix for about 8-10 minutes. The dough
should clump around the dough hook but still be sticky (and will not fully remove from the bottom
of the mixer bowl).

### Bulk fermentation

1. Leave the dough in a warm spot to bulk ferment for **3 hours and 30 minutes**. Perform 3 sets of
stretch and folds at the beginning, 30 minutes apart. When using my proofing box, I like to set the
bulk fermentation temperature to 26-27ºC.

### Shape and proof

1. Spray a 9x4x4 inch pullman pan with neutral oil. Tip the dough out into the counter, and shape
into a taut ball. Leave to relax for about 20-30 minutes.

1. Turn the dough over, and fold the top down to the middle, followed by folding the left- and
right-hand sides into the middle. You should have an upside-down open envelope. Start folding the
bottom up repeatedly, gently rolling it into a long tube (making sure to generate lots of tension
in the dough). Transfer to the pullman pan, seam side up.

1. Cover the pan with plastic, and leave to proof in a warm spot for 2.5 hours. When using my
proofing box, I like to set the bulk fermentation temperature to 25ºC.


### Bake

1. Preheat the oven with a rack on the bottom third, and a baking tray on the bottom of the oven, to 205ºC. 

1. Put the loaf pan in the oven on the rack, and pour water into the baking tray. Bake for 20 minutes.

1. After 20 minutes, vent the oven and remove the baking tray with water. Continue to bake for another 30-35 minutes. The internal temperature of the
loaf should be 96-99ºC.

1. Leave to rest on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before slicing.
