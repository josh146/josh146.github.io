Red braising is a braising technique used in Chinese cooking that produces a delicious caramel and savoury reddish-brown sauce. Traditionally made by caramelizing rock sugar in oil, a lot of recipes these days instead opt for dark soy sauce to lend those caramelized notes and hues.

Below is a blueprint recipe for red braised anything, as well as variations for red braised beef (hóngshāo niúròu) and red braised chicken, based on various recipes online including [Chinese cooking demystified](https://chinesecookingdemystified.substack.com/p/red-braised-anything).

## Instructions

{{chicken_sear_step}}

1. In a pot over medium heat, add a neutral oil and stir fry the {{aromatics}} until fragrant. Then,
add the {{spices}} and stir fry for 30 seconds. 

{{beef_sear_step}}

1. Stir through the Shaoxing wine, and then add the rest of the {{braising_liquid}} ingredients, adding enough stock or water to *just* cover the {{protein}}. Add
the {{vegetables}}, and then cook until your {{protein}} is {{tender}}[ref]You can simmer on the stovetop, or in the oven at 150ºC.[/ref].

1. Increase the heat to high, and rapidly reduce to the sauce (to approximately half to a third of the original volume).

1. If serving over noodles (such as lamian), no need to thicken the sauce. Simply prepare your
noodles as per directions (making sure to rinse the noodles under cold water), and then spoon over
a few ladles of broth, and top with the {{protein}}, {{vegetables}}, and {{garnishes}}.

1. If serving over rice, mix the cornflour with water to form a slurry, and add *half* of the
cornflour slurry. Reduce the sauce over medium heat until you are happy with the sauce
consistency --- add more cornflour slurry as needed. Serve alongside (or on top of) rice, adding the {{garnishes}} on top.
