A good all-purpose sponge cake recipe via [Claire Saffitz](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022270-sponge-cake), this recipe doesn't require a stand
mixer, simply a hand mixer, so is easy to put together. Note that it requires not using a non-stick
springform pan, however I've had luck making this in a non-stick springform (you just might not get
as much rise).

This is my go to cake recipe for making a lime-meringue cake, with layers of [[lime curd]] and
frosted with [[swiss meringue]].


## Ingredients

* 50g olive or vegetable oil
* 4 large eggs (separated, room temperature)
* 100g sugar (divided in two)
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1/4 tsp cream of tartar
* 85 grams cake flour
* 2 tsp vanilla extract

## Steps

1. Arrange an oven rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 160ºC.

	* If baking in a 9-inch springform pan, leave the pan ungreased and unlined.
	* If making a roulade, brush the bottom of a 10-by-15-inch pan with a light coating of oil --- do not brush the sides, as the cake needs to be able to cling to the pan as it rises. Line only the bottom of the pan with a piece of parchment paper, smoothing to eliminate air bubbles. 
	
1. **Beat the egg whites:** In a wide, medium bowl, combine the egg whites, half the sugar, the
kosher salt and cream of tartar. Beat the mixture with a hand mixer fitted with the beaters on
medium-low speed until the mixture looks frothy, then start to slowly increase the speed to
medium-high. Continue to beat the egg whites until you have a dense, voluminous, glossy foam that
forms stiff peaks, about 4 minutes. When you lift the beaters out of the bowl, the egg whites
should come to a straight point that doesn’t droop. Don’t beat beyond this point, or the whites
will become dry and lumpy. Set the bowl aside.

1. **Beat the egg yolks:** Beat with the hand mixer(no need to wash it after you beat the egg
whites) on medium-high until the mixture is very pale and fluffy and forms a slowly dissolving
ribbon as it falls off the beaters back into the bowl, about 4 minutes. Slowly stream in the oil,
beating constantly to ensure it emulsifies into the yolk mixture, until you have a smooth, light
mixture that looks like mayonnaise.

1. **Fold in the flour:** Reduce the mixer to the lowest speed, add half of the flour and mix just
until incorporated. Add the vanilla extract and 1 tablespoon water, mix until incorporated, then
add the remaining flour and mix just until it disappears. The mixture will have thickened and look
a bit like cake batter. Fold the yolk mixture once or twice with a large flexible spatula to make
sure it’s evenly mixed.

1. **Fold in the egg whites:** Scrape about a third of the egg white mixture into the yolk mixture
and thoroughly fold in the whites until the mixture is loosened. Working more gently, fold in half
of the remaining egg whites until only a few streaks remain. Fold in the remaining whites, scraping
the bottom and sides of the bowl, until you have a light, smooth, evenly mixed batter.

1. **Bake:** Scrape the batter into the pan and smooth into an even layer. Firmly rap the pan on the
surface once or twice to pop any large air bubbles. Bake the cake until it’s golden brown, firm and
springy to the touch across the entire surface, 25 to 30 minutes for a jelly roll and 30 to 35
minutes for a 9-inch cake.

1. **Cool:** Remove the cake from the oven and immediately invert the pan onto a wire rack. Let the
cake cool completely upside down to prevent it from collapsing.

1. Reinvert the cooled pan and cut along the sides with a small offset spatula or paring knife to
loosen the cake. It will sink a bit, which is normal. If making a jelly roll, turn the sponge out
onto the wire rack and peel off the parchment. If making a 9-inch cake, remove the ring of the
springform pan, invert the cake onto the rack, and carefully peel off the bottom of the pan
(it should come away cleanly, leaving behind just a thin film).

## Notes

The unfilled sponge cake will keep at room temperature, tightly wrapped, for several days, but will
become sticky after the first day.
