## Ingredients

* 500g [[Pâte feuilletée (puff pastry)]]
* 2 heirloom tomatoes (thinly sliced)
* 180g goat's cheese (crumbled)
* 2 tbsp olive oil

### Sauce

* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 onion (finely diced)
* 400g cherry tomatoes (either canned or fresh)
* 2 garlic cloves (thinly sliced)
* 3 thyme sprigs
* 1 tsp pepper
* 10 large basil leaves (torn)
* Salt, to taste

## Steps

1. Roll out the puff pastry until 5mm thick. Line the base and side of the tart tin (either a 25cm
  tart ring *or* a 25cm tart pan with a removeable base). Refrigerate for 30 minutes.

1. To make the sauce, heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, reduce
  the heat to medium and cook until softened and golden. Add the tomatoes, garlic, thyme, and
  pepper, and cover and simmer for 15 minutes or until thickened and reduced. Add the basil leaves,
  season to taste with salt, and remove from the heat to cool down to room temperature.

1. Preheat the oven to 190ºC. Using crumpled parchment paper and baking beads, blind bake the tart
  shell for 20 minutes, or until the base is golden. Remove the parchment and set aside to cool.
  Reduce the oven temperature to 180ºC.

1. Spread the cooled sauce over the base of the tart. Pplace the sliced tomatoes over the top,
  arranging them in overlapping concentric circles, then scatter over the goat's cheese. Bake on
  the bottom third of the oven for 25 minutes, or until pastry is golden.

1. Serve with a drizzle of olive oil, and additional torn basil leaves.
