<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

I had bought a bus ticket leaving Takayama the next day at lunch time, heading directly to Kanazawa. Well, sort of - I decided to make a brief stop (about an hour) in [Shirakawa-go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_Villages_of_Shirakawa-g%C5%8D_and_Gokayama), a UNESCO World Heritage Site village comprised of centuries old gassh≈ç-zukuri style houses. Remember the Hida-no-sato outdoor folk museum? Well, this is the (living) village that those houses were taken from.

Unfortunately, I spent a majority of my time crossing a suspension bridge across the river dividing the village.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

It was such a picturesque village - essentially Hida-no-sato brought to life.

And as it is a living village, of course there is no entry fee - filling the park with numerous Japanese visitors enjoying the scenery, walking their dogs, or building snowmen with their family.

But that suspension bridge, oh god. Located right in the middle of the Japanese Alps, it was no surprise that it was cold, and it was covered in a layer of ice maybe 10 cm thick. Everyone was reduced to slowly sliding their feet across it, leading to an almost 20 minute passage.

This for a bridge that would take maybe 1 minute to walk across in summer!
