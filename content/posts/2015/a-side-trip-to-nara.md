<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

On my last day in Kyoto, I decided to do a quick trip (45 minutes by train) to [Nara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nara,_Nara), the former capital of Japan from 710-784, and perhaps even more known for its temples than Kyoto.

Oh, and also for its 1200 wild deer.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Firstly, the wild deer are *so tame*. I managed to get within centimeters of one without it even flinching.

## The deer

The deer are basically the main tourist attraction, never mind the temples. You have these massive, centries old temples towering over you, and 90% of the people there are feeding the deers/attempting deer selfies (not that I wasn't guilty of this either).

<br>

I was too nervous to feed the deer myself (I was having flashbacks to being bitten by a deer when I was 6 years old on safari), but you could tell that was all they were really looking out for. Case in point; the woman below searching her bag for her phone.

But the temples were pretty stunning, once you're able to look past all the deer.

## Temples

Tōdai-ji is one of the biggest temples in Nara - rebuilt in 1709, it currently houses the worlds largest wooden statue of the Buddha. On the downside, due to the high price of entry (I assume), it is relatively deer-free.

## Walk through Nara Park

After visiting Tōdai-ji, I took a brief walk around the park, growing increasingly aware of my grumbling stomach.

[!pic?caption=I didn't catch the name of this temple, but it is obviously more deer-friendly than Todai-ji](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-BNL4hdBF96I/VJz8uRxbhBI/AAAAAAABHyk/t9PAvX2Rd78/w1315-h877-no/DSC06343.JPG)

## Tuna

Nara park seems so isolated and rural, that it's somewhat jarring to turn a corner and suddenly find yourself in the middle of a busy shopping arcade. But, it was time for lunch, so I set out to find a back-alley tuna restaurant I'd read up about online.

[!pic?caption=First, though, I got a little bit distracted by Daiso](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zFqgAZhrjmU/VJz9BkJZLVI/AAAAAAABH1E/TrP3jduTt_A/w1315-h877-no/DSC06378.JPG)

[!pic?caption=Found it](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4NR4vz3JE1I/VJz9J6TpHAI/AAAAAAABH2s/sySGUfDafJo/w1315-h877-no/DSC06392.JPG)

<br>

The main draw of this restaurant is basically this: it sells nothing but tuna dishes, but it does them *well*. Plus, it also uses quality tuna - with all dishes you have a choice between maguro (bluefin tuna), chūtoro (medium fatty tuna), and ōtoro (very fatty tuna - expensive but oh so good).

I did a quick scan of the restaurant; the two most popular dishes (actually, the *only* two dishes being ordered) were the ōtoro sashimi and the ōtoro karage.

So, uh, since they both sounded so good...

... I got both.
