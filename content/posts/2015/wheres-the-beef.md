<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

Now this is a pretty big statement, but bear with me for a second; Takayama is (so far) my favorite place I've visited in Japan.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

To start off with, there is snow. *Lots* of snow. And coming from Australia and Singapore, snow is still pretty much a massive novelty for me.

Second favorite reason; there is a park within the town called [Hida no Sato](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hida_Minzoku_Mura_Folk_Village) (Hida Folk Village), an open air museum of 30 old farmhouses (dating back to the 16th century) with steep, thatched roofs ('gassh≈ç style'), required for the long, cold winters.

Covered with almost a meter of snow, it was *magical*.

Also, the town itself. As it is a designated preservation area, all new houses have to be built in the Edo style - leading to an amazing picturesque (but somewhat surreal, espcially when you have BMWs driving out of wooden garages) old town.

The street food was pretty good as well.

But I've kept the best reason till last. It turns out that the region Takayama is in is famous for it's beef - Hida beef, just slightly down in terms of quality from Kobe beef. And for the first time since I've been in Japan, I no longer had to be on the lookout for Pork; Hida beef was used *everywhere*, for *everything*. It was **glorious**.

Oh, and did I mention I had the best hamburger in my life (no kidding, for real) in Takayama? Center 4 Hamburgers is the only hamburger place in town, and all their patties are made from Hida beef. They actually melt in your mouth.

I was in heaven.
