A bit 'off the beaten path' (I use inverted commas, because, let's face it, Japan is *extremely* well connected, and here 'off the beaten path' basically means 'there is no Shinkansen connection'[^1] -- *oh god the horror, I have to catch a bus*), Kanazawa is not often frequented by overseas travellers. Or so, many online travel guides seemed to assure me. Nevertheless, I had 2 days to kill before heading to Nagano, and visiting Kanazawa seemed like a nice stopover. Furthermore, considering the time of year (28th of December), it would be pretty nice to be stranded in a larger city rather than a tiny rural village on the off-chance that everything would be closed ([one of my biggest worries](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2276.html)).

## Rain, mist and moats

Kanazawa certainly has a different feel from other Japanese cities I'd visited -- perhaps it was its smaller size, relative isolation (and I use the term *very* weakly), and coastal location, but everything seemed a bit slower and more relaxed. The entire time I was there there was a constant drizzle, which didn't bother me too much -- I was kind of expecting it, given Kanazawa's reputation as the Seattle of Japan.

What I wasn't expecting however were the complex network of tree-lined canals permeating the city, ensuring wide, open public spaces that left a small-town feel in the middle of a bustling city street. Even cooler, I later found out that these canals are remnants of '[enclosure moats](http://www.kanazawa-hakusan.com/english/water.html)' built during the Edo period to strengthen the cities defences, and are the only remaining enclosure moats in Japan.

Even better though -- the canals provide an excellent navigational tool, especially when you arrive after dark and are delirious from hunger.

(Somehow I still managed to get lost -- '*oh shit the canals are diverging*' -- and ended up getting take-out yakitori at a local Lawson. But let's not dwell on that).

The next day, by randomly meandering along the canals, I also chance upon some amazing food, including Saint Nicolas, a French Patisserie.

[^1]: A massive development since my visit is the opening of the [Nagano-Kanazawa leg of the Hokuriku Shinkansen](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2018_nagano.html) on March 14th, 2015 -- travel to Kanazawa from Tokyo now takes as little as 2 and a half hours!
