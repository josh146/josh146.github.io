Earlier this year, I was lucky enough to give a talk on quantum computing and near-term quantum
machine learning at PyCon 2021. I've always loved the PyCon and SciPy conferences; in fact, one of
my earliest memories during the first month of my quantum computing job was watching [A Better
Default Colormap for Matplotlib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU) from SciPy 2015. It
was my first freezing Toronto winter, snow and ice were baralleling past the window, and the
comforting sound of the garment press above --- our office was situated in an old building in the
Fashion district, typical for an early stage startup --- punctuated my viewing every couple of
minutes with a heavy HISSS *thunk*.

The thing I loved most about traversing the PyCon YouTube playlist was not just the diverse topics
of talks, but the level of *detail* available. Delve into the story of [API compatibility between
NumPy and PyTorch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wk13yle5GA), how to [utilize Python for
knitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7LEN2oqpkM), how Python [automatically inserts `self`
into methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANLjBsWHshc), or what happens when you find yourself
[accidentally becoming an open source maintainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPs64t1nsSM). And
these are all talks from this year!

For a while, I've often daydreamed what *I* would talk about if I had the opportunity to talk
at PyCon. It turns out, it's the same thing I am passionate about day-to-day (who would have thought!) --- how we can use Python to differentiate and train real quantum devices.

Finally, I just want to provide a big thank you to the PyCon 2021 organizers. Organizing a
conference of this size is *hard*, let alone during a global pandemic. With all the upheaval over
the last year and a half, I find it incredibly amazing  that I was able to participate from so far
away --- Google informs me that there is 18,300 km separating Western Australia from Pittsburgh,
the original location of PyCon 2021!
