1. Taking out the trash is *insanely* complicated. I'm still trying to wrap my head around it.

2. There are vending machines *everywhere*, for almost *everything*. So, at least I know I can never starve - there is a Cup Noodle vending machine on campus!

3. It's not just a stereotype. Toilets *are* way fancier! Mine has a seat warmer. And plays music. I didn't even know I needed that before I had it.

4. Japan truly is a cash based society. The only ATM on campus accepts only local credit cards, meaning I'll eventually need to head to a post office in the nearest town when I run out of cash. Luckily, a few places (such as the 24hr minimarts) accept international cards.

5. THERE IS A PINEAPPLE THEME PARK ON OKINAWA - [Nago Pineapple Park](http://www.nagopineapplepark.com/english/). The other postdocs have been singing its theme song all day. I NEED TO GO THERE.
