I'm not really sure how it happened, but at some point reminiscing over Hanukkah (this is the second year in a row I've been away from home during Hanukkah) turned into a fully fledged plan to make latkes, find jam donuts, and somehow construct a Hanukiah.

As you can imagine, this was a pretty big mission for somewhere like Okinawa (specifically, central Okinawa) - Google searches returned nothing but Facebook posts from Kadena airbase lamenting the lack of instant latke mix and the horrible variety of kosher meat available from the base commissary.

Giving up on the jam donuts (read: we couldn't find a syringe in order to, uh, *make* jam donuts - I'm still shocked they were so impossible to find, I thought they were some sort of worldwide staple?), we decided to improvise.

Unfortunately we later found out upon eating the Hanukiah (that's not sacrilegious, is it?) that it was more like a butter cake - it wasn't even deep fried in oil!

>#### Butter counts, right? Maybe it was the miracle of oil **and** butter.
