<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

>### *The longest bridge on an open road in Japan, connecting Kouri Island and Yagaji Island* - [Okinawa2go](http://en.okinawa2go.jp/is/OCVB1EN0600000703/show)

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Not sure where to go after the aquarium, and having the rental car until 7pm that night, we studiously studied the map given to us.

'We're pretty close to [Okinawa Ostrich Show Land](okinawahai.com/okinawa-ostrich-show-land/),' pondered Tania.

'wait. WHAT.'

My mind swirled with possibilities; based on its name alone, this place had the potential to even eclipse Pineapple Park.

'I looked it up the other day, it's not actually that great. They have ostriches and turkeys, and a restaurant that serves ostrich meat and eggs.'

'Oh.'

'Oh you can also go for Ostrich rides.'   

'OKAY NOW WE *HAVE* TO GO.'

Before you get your hopes up - unfortunately I was on the losing side of that argument - a little while later we decided upon the much more sensible (sigh) plan of driving to Kourijima (Kouri Island), to explore some of Okinawa's coastline and walk along the longest open-road bridge in Japan.

And it was well worth it (although on the other hand, How do you compete with *ostrich riding*). It seems the further north we go on Okinawa-honto, the more picturesque it becomes.

So all in all, it was a pretty fun day. Below you can see a map of the route we ended up doing.
