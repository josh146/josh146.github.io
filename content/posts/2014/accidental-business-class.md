I started boarding my flight to Okinawa (an [Airbus A330-300](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A330) twin engine jet), and entered at the front of the plane, ready to find my seat 17A. *Oh wow*, I thought - *this is pretty nice!*. I knew [Dragonair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonair) was a subsidiary of Cathay Pacific, and had just assumed it was budget carrier - I was expecting something on the spectrum of Jetstar to Tigerair.

I got a glimpse of the next cabin down; a cramped 2-4-2 seat configuration. Damn it. I was in business class! I had gotten excited there for a second. Begrudgingly I put my head down and walked over to the start of Economy.

*Seats 20ABC*

Well, that can't be right. I stare back at my ticket - *Economy: 17A*. I took a few steps back into business class and stared dumbfoundedly at seat 17A. It was only then that I remembered what Dragonair's online check in system said when I got my boarding pass back in Perth:

<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
> ###*Note: the seat you have chosen has additional leg room, and you may be moved prior to departure.*
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Only they failed to mention that the reason it had extra legroom was because ***it was in bloody business class***.

I took my seat, nervously glancing around. I felt like an imposter. Surely someone was going to come along any second and ask me to move; it can't be that easy, can it? *Just, I don't know, pick your seat to be in business class?*. I made a mental note to try this again on my next flight (a part of me knew their system must have stuffed up, but I couldn't help but feel like I had found a quick and easy trick to upgrade yourself. For free!).

One by one the plane finished filling up, everyone walking passed me and making their way into economy class. I could see the look of envy in their faces. (Perhaps. It was at this point that you could argue that it was going to my head a bit.)

The plane was full, and I received a business class welcome from the stewardess. Success! Maybe I was *destined* for business class (okay, definetely going to my head). The safety briefing begun, and being the only person in business class, I made sure to follow intently and nod along encouragingly. I realised somewhat alarmingly that this was the first airline safety briefing I've ever really paid attention to.

At this point I went somewhat snap happy. I was in business class! I had to document it.

Watch a movie? Pffft, I need to
