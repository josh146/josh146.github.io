<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

I started boarding my flight to Okinawa (an [Airbus A330-300](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A330) twin engine jet), and entered at the front of the plane, ready to find my seat 17A. *Oh wow*, I thought - *this is pretty nice!*. I knew [Dragonair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonair) was a subsidiary of Cathay Pacific, and had just assumed it was budget carrier - I was expecting something on the spectrum of Jetstar to Tigerair.

I got a glimpse of the next cabin down; a cramped 2-4-2 seat configuration. I must be in business class! Albeit not the same standard as business class in an A380, but still pretty luxurious. Damn it. I had gotten excited there for a second. Begrudgingly I put my head down and walked over to the start of Economy.

*Seats 20ABC*

Well, that can't be right. I stare back at my ticket - *Economy: 17A*. I took a few steps back into business class and stared dumbfoundedly at seat 17A. It was only then that I remembered what Dragonair's online check in system said when I got my boarding pass back in Perth:

> ####Note: the seat you have chosen has additional leg room, and you may be moved prior to departure.

Only they failed to mention that the reason it had extra legroom was because ***it was in bloody business class***.

I took my seat, nervously glancing around. I felt like an imposter. Surely someone was going to come along any second and ask me to move; it can't be that easy, can it? *To just, I don't know, pick your seat to be in business class?* I made a mental note to try this again on my next flight (a part of me knew their system must have stuffed up, but I couldn't help but feel like I had found a quick and easy trick to upgrade yourself. For free!).

One by one the plane finished filling up, everyone walking passed me and making their way into economy class. I could see the look of envy in their faces. (Perhaps. It was at this point that you could argue that it was going to my head a bit.)

The plane was full, and I received a business class welcome from the stewardess. Success! Maybe I was *destined* for business class (okay, definitely going to my head). The safety briefing begun, and being the only person in business class, I made sure to follow intently and nod along encouragingly. I realised somewhat alarmingly that this was the first airline safety briefing I've ever really paid attention to.

At this point I went somewhat snap happy, most of which is evident from the photos in this post. I was in business class! I had to document it.

Watch a movie? Pffft, I need to see how far my seat reclines!

Listen to music? Ooooh, there are two power points! I'll charge my laptop instead.

Oh, and did I mention how much leg room I had?

Oh, and there was some pretty cool stuff happening outside the plane as well. Like these amazingly clear views of Hong Kong:

I would have taken more, but I probably got distracted again by how much leg room I had.
