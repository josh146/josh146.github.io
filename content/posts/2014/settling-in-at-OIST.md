<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

Having reached Naha - the capital of Okinawa Island - and then taking a two hour bus ride from Naha Airport, I eventually reached the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, or [OIST](http://oist.jp) (pronounced /ɔɪst/), my home for the next month. Literally five seconds after arriving and finding my apartment, I was invited by the other postdocs on their weekly supermarket shop over in Ishikawa, a town approximately 20 minutes away by car.

It seemed somewhat important, so I tagged along, soon finding myself trying to do my first weekly supermarket shop in Japan straight after almost 24 hours of travel.

To say I was slightly overwhelmed would be an understatement.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

*"Make sure you only buy the milk that has 100% cows milk, not 10%!"*

*"Don't forget to buy cooking essentials!"*

Crap. Um, lets see; salt, pepper, cooking oil, meat ("I can't tell the difference between the chicken and the pork?" *"You're in Japan! Don't buy chicken, buy some sashimi!"*), bread, vegetables, peanut butter (ooh they have Skippy Extra Chunk!), crispy m&m's -

"Wait, what cooking appliances are there in the apartments?"

*"A stove."*

"No oven? Toaster?"

*"No, but you have a fish grill!"*

I later learnt why this trip seemed so important; the isolation of the OIST campus, coupled with the underdeveloped Okinawan public transport system, makes it quite difficult to reach shops/services/amenities without a car. Getting my international drivers license before leaving Perth - assuming I would probably never need it - turned out to be a brilliant decision. But more on that later.

---------------------------

The next morning, after unpacking and settling in to my apartment, I decided to explore the campus (it was a public holiday - [Labor Thanksgiving Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Thanksgiving_Day) - so no uni today). 

And for all its isolation, the OIST campus definitely makes up for it. It is ***stunning***.

To reach the main campus from the apartments, you enter a covered walk way that takes you passed man-made lakes and waterfalls, before heading underground - an almost surreal turn that feels more like an underground government bunker than a university.

From here it gets even cooler; taking the elevator up brings you to the Central Building, a circular structure housing administration and cafes, connected by 'skywalks' to the two research buildings, Lab 1 and Lab 2 (Lab 3 is currently under construction). The views are nothing less than spectacular.

For the next month, I'll be working with [C. M. Chandrashekar](https://chandrashekarcm.wordpress.com/) and Thomas Busch of the [Quantum Systems Unit](https://groups.oist.jp/qsu), specifically looking at and exploring quantum walks and percolation theory. Which might be quite challenging, considering the code provided is in C, which I have next to no knowledge off (ugh Fortran, why do you have to be ingrained in modern scientific computation).

So, better get started!
