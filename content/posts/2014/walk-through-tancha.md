<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

Since my first full day in Okinawa coincided with a public holiday, after [exploring the campus]({filename}settling-in-at-OIST.md) I decided to take a walk along the beach towards the Onno No Eki farmers market in the town of Nakadomari (suggested by Thomas). 

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

It was on this walk that I realised just how isolated the campus is if you don't have a car - the nearest minimart is the almost ubiquitous [FamilyMart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FamilyMart) ([Lawson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawson_%28store%29) is also around, but no sign of 7-Eleven), a 20 minute walk - whilst the two nearest towns, Nakadomari and Onna, are both a one hour walk east and west respectively. So, along with seeing what was on offer at the farmers market, I aimed to get my bearings, check out FamilyMart, and take a leisurely (ha) one hour stroll along the beach.

It didn't all go entirely to plan.

The first part of my walk was from OIST down to the beach; this part of Okinawa (Tancha) is mostly residential, with one small shop and a restaurant ([Pancake Island Cafe](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-K2FP09RZ3Co/VHNFjcCEFvI/AAAAAAABDOA/IrZN1Xv6CQM/w1352-h902-no/DSC04865.JPG)). The style of house on Okinawa is quite distinctive; large concrete blocks with the entire ground floor consisting of a garage. This is due to the Okinawa's location in the [Typhoon Alley](http://www.stripes.com/news/complacency-is-a-risk-in-typhoon-alley-1.91377) - when faced with a choice between traditional Japanese style dwellings that could ultimately fly away each year, and giant slabs of concrete, it's somewhat of a no-brainer. (On the other hand, [cars have been known to embed themselves up to 3m high in concrete buildings during previous typhoons](http://www.stripes.com/news/complacency-is-a-risk-in-typhoon-alley-1.91377)).

Unfortunately, this causes the cityscape to become quite ugly and monotonous after a while (but hey, practicality always wins). 

Another cool addition on almost all the houses were the presence of [Shīsas](http://www.stripes.com/military-life/distinctive-lion-dogs-a-defining-facet-of-okinawa-s-culture-1.58788), or guardian lion-dogs. Usually found in pairs, they adorn the roofs and/or gates of almost all Okinawan buildings;  always one with an open mouth to catch good fortune, the other with a closed mouth to keep good fortune in.

You can only take so many photos of Shīsas and concrete houses, so I started to venture off the road and onto the beach. Which, by the way, is seriously impressive and a feature not normally associated with Japan.

I couldn't get over how empty and seemingly undeveloped it was. And it was almost a 30 degree day! Ridiculous, in Perth it would have been *packed*. I was told that the water is too cold to swim in this time of year, but that's no excuse. The water temperature was *so much warmer* than Perth. Only negatives: the arguably uninviting presence of stonefish in the shallow water (and you do not want to accidentally step on a stonefish).

Not soon after I finally hit my first beach resort, and ventured back to the street to the welcoming presence of FamilyMart. It was everything I expected, and more. Bank! Hot food! Cold food! Actually all types of food! Cup noodle galore! Bento boxes! Ice-cream (couldn't resist some Haagen-Dazs on this relatively humid day)! Electronics! Hentai! (wait, what?)

I knew the ATM here wouldn't work with international credit cards, but out the corner of my eye I saw the Citibank Japan logo (*Oh! Maybe Citibank Australia will work here!*). I was so determined I tried three times (three different card rotations, that's how desperate I was to get it to work). Alas.

I'm probably quite lucky my card wasn't eaten after all that.

As I passed more and more beach resorts, the road quickly became saturated with tourist paraphenalia and restaurants (I started to pass a unending chain of hamburger restaurants, gift shops - including a place that solely sold shells - and diving centers).

It was here that I finally gave in and decided to have something to eat; the food just became way too tempting. Whilst Japanese cuisine is very closely associated with fish and seafood, Okinawan cuisine is [significantly different](http://travel.cnn.com/okinawa-restaurant-order-508481), due to the independence of the island as part of the [Ryukyu Kingdom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryukyu_Kingdom) from the 15th to 19th centuries. High levels of Chinese trade over the years led to Pork becoming an important staple in Okinawa (lucky me - the one meat I don't eat), along with unique dishes such as [sea grapes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caulerpa_lentillifera) (also known as seaweed caviar) and [sata andagi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sata_andagi), deep-fried dough (i.e. a doughnut) available n a delicious array of flavours.

The American occupation of Okinawa from 1945-1968 also resulted in a bizarre new Okinawan dish - [taco rice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco_rice)! Apparently everything about tacos were a hit except the shells themselves. In fact, every Thursday and Friday at OIST is taco rice day - the one day everyone seems to queue for the same bento box. 

Eventually I settled on a cool beachside bar/seafood restaurant (I refuse to admit the promise of free wifi factored into the decision whatsoever), and ordered a delicious array of yakitori. Well, I tried to, but all I got was several plates of chicken yakitori. Apparently the 'point and hope for the best' method of ordering wasn't as foolproof as I was led to believe. (There were even pictures to point at! Oh well, it was all stupidly delicious and I was too hungry to argue.)

I ate, paid, and continued on my journey. Everything was going amazingly considering I've become way too reliant on GPS. Well, almost. It was here that I hit a fork in road.

I must have agonized over which direction to take for hours (read: 5 minutes), and since it was pretty dark by this stage, and I'd been out for over one and a half hours, I made the painful decision to turn back.

I later found out that if I turned right and continued along the beach (rather than turned left and headed into the main part of Nakadomari), I would have reached the farmers market.

I was a mere 10 minutes away.

It wasn't all bad though. On the way back, I bought a plastic container for leftover food from FamilyMart!

Only to put it in the microwave and completely destroy it as soon as I got home.

Goddamit.
