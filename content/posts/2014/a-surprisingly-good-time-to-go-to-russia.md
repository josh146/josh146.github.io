Today whilst working, I had this website playing in the background:

Soothing music with tranquilizing flowing backgrounds; oh, and in the foreground you can watch the Rouble plunge to terriying new lows. All in real time!

In case you haven't heard, the Russian rouble has been free-falling for the last couple of weeks, losing half its value since September 1st. An insane last minute interest rate hike to 17% by the Russian central bank [hasn't even managed to stabilise it](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-30492518) - it has dropped another USD$10 in just half a day.

Whilst this is terrible news for the Russian economy, this crisis (and I feel a bit bad about saying this) makes it actually a [pretty good time to be a tourist in Russia](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/2pdwps/psa_if_you_want_to_travel_russia_on_a_budget_nows/). A three course meal in Moscow (one of the most expensive cities in Europe, but arguably not that bad compared to Perth) cost around \$27-\$41 three months ago.

As of today, that's now \$15-\$23.

So, uh, I guess in hindsight we made a pretty good decision (at least for our bank accounts) to head to Russia and Siberia this winter?
