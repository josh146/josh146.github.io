<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

Recently, OIST and the University of Tokyo signed a a memorandum of understanding, resulting in a set of informal seminars between eminent UoT scientists and their OIST counterparts. This actually took place over Friday and Saturday, and whilst I initially mourned the loss of a weekend sleep in (*The morning session starts at 9!?*), the physics related lectures were pretty enjoyable.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Unfortunately I missed out on the biology lectures, as they commenced at 9am on Friday (and I needed to make up *somehow* for my early start on Saturday), and the chemistry lectures took place whilst we were on our way to Cape Hedo, so that was also a shame.

Although it might not have made much of a difference if I had made it, judging by Angela's response later:

"Unfortunately I didn't understand a word of the lectures."

"Oh, were they in Japanese?"

"No, they were in biology!"

The talks I ended up going to were:

* *Beauty of Symmetry and Symmetry Breaking* by [Hiroaki Aihara](http://tkybel1.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index-j.html) (after discussing his multi-million dollar high energy physics experiment, one of the questions was *'is that a bit of a waste of money?'* *'I hope not, since we've already started!'* he replied)

* *Light-Matter Interactions Research at OIST* by [SÃ­le Nic Chormaic](https://groups.oist.jp/light), an interesting insight into experimental physics at OIST

* *Information, thermodynamics, and Maxwell's demon* by [Masahito Ueda](http://cat.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index-e.html) (I really enjoyed this talk)

* *Controlling and Engineering Quantum Systems* by [Thomas Busch](https://groups.oist.jp/qsu) (unfortunately though the Spongebob group photo didn't make it into the slides)

All in all, it was a nice break from the occasional monotony of office work.
