	abstract = {In the general field of quantum information and computation, quantum walks are playing an increasingly important role in constructing physical models and quantum algorithms. We have recently developed a distributed memory software package {pyCTQW}, with an object-oriented Python interface, that allows efficient simulation of large multi-particle {CTQW} (continuous-time quantum walk)-based systems. In this paper, we present an introduction to the Python and Fortran interfaces of {pyCTQW}, discuss various numerical methods of calculating the matrix exponential, and demonstrate the performance behavior of {pyCTQW} on a distributed memory cluster. In particular, the Chebyshev and Krylov-subspace methods for calculating the quantum walk propagation are provided, as well as methods for visualization and data analysis.

Nature of problem:

Simulates, visualizes and analyzes continuous-time quantum walks on arbitrary undirected graphs.

Solution method:

Distributed memory implementations of the matrix exponential, via a choice of Krylov-subspace and Chebyshev expansion techniques, are used to simulate the continuous-time quantum walkers. Visualization ability is provided via the supplied Python module and Matplotlib.

Restrictions:

The size of the quantum walking system is limited by the amount of available memory. The current package implements up to 3 simultaneous walkers with interactions, but it can be readily extended.

Unusual features:

In addition to utilizing a parallelized Krylov subspace method and Chebyshev approximation scheme to maximize efficiency, {pyCTQW} also provides functions for visualization of the quantum walk dynamics and calculation of multi-particle entanglement, and allows for arbitrary diagonal defects to be placed on graph nodes to explore transmission and resonance structures.

Running time:

Runtime varies depending on the size of the graph, number of processors used, and number of simultaneous walkers.

	abstract = {We investigate the scattering properties of quantum walks by considering single and double position defects on a one-dimensional line. This corresponds to introducing, at designated positions, delta potential defects for continuous-time quantum walks and phase-defect Hadamard coins for discrete time quantum walks. The delta potential defects can be readily considered as potential barriers in discrete position space, which affect the time evolution of the system in a similar way as the quantum wave-packet dynamics in a continuous position space governed by Schr\"{o}dinger's equation. Although there is no direct analogy of potential barriers in the theoretical formulation of discrete time quantum walks, in this paper we show that the phase defects in the coin space can be utilized to provide similar scattering effects. This study provides means of controlling the scattering properties of quantum walks by introducing designated position-dependent defects.},

Whilst both the single-particle {DTQW} and {CTQW} have failed to distinguish non-isomorphic strongly regular graph families (prompting the move to multi-particle graph isomorphism {(GI)} algorithms), the single-particle {DTQW} has been successfully modified by the introduction of a phase factor to distinguish a wide range of graphs in polynomial time. In this paper, we prove that an analogous phase modification to the single particle {CTQW} does not have the same distinguishing power as its discrete-time counterpart, in particular it cannot distinguish strongly regular graphs with the same family parameters with the same efficiency.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02673},
	abstract = {Various quantum-walk based algorithms have been proposed to analyse and rank the centrality of graph vertices. However, issues arise when working with directed graphs -- the resulting {non-Hermitian} Hamiltonian leads to non-unitary dynamics, and the quantum walker is no longer conserved. In this paper, we discuss a method for simulating directed graphs using {PT-symmetric} quantum walks, allowing probability conserving non-unitary evolution. This method is equivalent to mapping the directed graph to an undirected, yet weighted, complete graph over the same vertex set. It can be extended to cover interdependent networks of directed graphs. Finally, we use this framework to implement a quantum algorithm for centrality testing on directed graphs with a significantly reduced Hilbert space compared to previous proposals. We demonstrate that, in certain cases, this centrality measure provides an advantage over classical algorithms used in network analysis, for example by breaking vertex rank degeneracy.},

Complex resonance behavior is demonstrated, showing alternating bands of zero and perfect transmission for various defect parameters. Furthermore, we provide an efficient numerical method to characterize quantum walks in the presence of diagonal disorder, paving the way for selective control of quantum walks via the optimization of position-dependent defects. The numerical method can be readily extended to higher dimensions and multiple interacting walkers.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate that the stray magnetic field generated beneath magnetic vortex cores can be used to generate nano-scale, localized pinning sites for magnetic domain walls in an underlying, perpendicularly magnetized nanostrip. Moreover, the pinning strength can be tuned by toggling the vortex core polarity. Indeed, switching the core polarity so that it is aligned with the magnetization of the expanding domain (rather than against it) can be used to reduce the vortex-mediated wall depinning field by between 40\% and 90\%, depending on the system geometry. Significant reductions in the depinning field can also be obtained in narrow strips by shifting the core away from the strip's center.},
