	abstract = {In the general field of quantum information and computation, quantum walks are playing an increasingly important role in constructing physical models and quantum algorithms. We have recently developed a distributed memory software package {pyCTQW}, with an object-oriented Python interface, that allows efficient simulation of large multi-particle {CTQW} (continuous-time quantum walk)-based systems. In this paper, we present an introduction to the Python and Fortran interfaces of {pyCTQW}, discuss various numerical methods of calculating the matrix exponential, and demonstrate the performance behavior of {pyCTQW} on a distributed memory cluster. In particular, the Chebyshev and Krylov-subspace methods for calculating the quantum walk propagation are provided, as well as methods for visualization and data analysis.},

	abstract = {We investigate the scattering properties of quantum walks by considering single and double position defects on a one-dimensional line. This corresponds to introducing, at designated positions, delta potential defects for continuous-time quantum walks and phase-defect Hadamard coins for discrete time quantum walks. The delta potential defects can be readily considered as potential barriers in discrete position space, which affect the time evolution of the system in a similar way as the quantum wave-packet dynamics in a continuous position space governed by Schr\"{o}dinger's equation. Although there is no direct analogy of potential barriers in the theoretical formulation of discrete time quantum walks, in this paper we show that the phase defects in the coin space can be utilized to provide similar scattering effects. This study provides means of controlling the scattering properties of quantum walks by introducing designated position-dependent defects.},

Whilst both the single-particle {DTQW} and {CTQW} have failed to distinguish non-isomorphic strongly regular graph families (prompting the move to multi-particle graph isomorphism {(GI)} algorithms), the single-particle {DTQW} has been successfully modified by the introduction of a phase factor to distinguish a wide range of graphs in polynomial time. In this paper, we prove that an analogous phase modification to the single particle {CTQW} does not have the same distinguishing power as its discrete-time counterpart, in particular it cannot distinguish strongly regular graphs with the same family parameters with the same efficiency.},

	abstract = {Various quantum-walk based algorithms have been proposed to analyse and rank the centrality of graph vertices. However, issues arise when working with directed graphs -- the resulting {non-Hermitian} Hamiltonian leads to non-unitary dynamics, and the quantum walker is no longer conserved. In this paper, we discuss a method for simulating directed graphs using {PT-symmetric} quantum walks, allowing probability conserving non-unitary evolution. This method is equivalent to mapping the directed graph to an undirected, yet weighted, complete graph over the same vertex set. It can be extended to cover interdependent networks of directed graphs. Finally, we use this framework to implement a quantum algorithm for centrality testing on directed graphs with a significantly reduced Hilbert space compared to previous proposals. We demonstrate that, in certain cases, this centrality measure provides an advantage over classical algorithms used in network analysis, for example by breaking vertex rank degeneracy.},

In this paper, we derive analytic expressions for the eigenstates of a one-dimensional continuous-time quantum walk interacting with a single defect, before investigating the effects of multiple diagonal defects and disorder, with emphasis on its transmission and reflection properties. Complex resonance behavior is demonstrated, showing alternating bands of zero and perfect transmission for various defect parameters. Furthermore, we provide an efficient numerical method to characterize quantum walks in the presence of diagonal disorder, paving the way for selective control of quantum walks via the optimization of position-dependent defects. The numerical method can be readily extended to higher dimensions and multiple interacting walkers.},

As a proof of concept, the algorithm is detailed on a four-vertex star graph and physically implemented via linear optics, using spatial and polarization degrees of freedoms of single photons.

	abstract = {The conventional Quantum Fourier Transform, with exponential speedup compared to the classical Fast Fourier Transform, has played an important role in quantum computation as a vital part of many quantum algorithms (most prominently, the Shor's factoring algorithm). However, situations arise where it is not sufficient to encode the Fourier coefficients within the quantum amplitudes, for example in the implementation of control operations that depend on Fourier coefficients. In this paper, we detail a new quantum algorithm to encode the Fourier coefficients in the computational basis, with success probability $1-\delta$ and desired precision $\epsilon$. Its time complexity $O((\log N)^2\log(N/\delta)/\epsilon)\big)$ depends polynomially on $\log(N)$, where $N$ is the problem size, and linearly on $\log(1/\delta)$ and $1/\epsilon$. We also discuss an application of potential practical importance, namely the simulation of circulant Hamiltonians.},

Here, we demonstrate that the stray magnetic field generated beneath magnetic vortex cores can be used to generate localized pinning sites for magnetic domain walls in an underlying, perpendicularly magnetized nanostrip. Moreover, we show that the pinning strength can be tuned by switching the vortex core polarity: switching the core polarity so that it is aligned with the magnetization of the expanding domain (rather than against it) can reduce the vortex-mediated wall depinning field by between 40\% and 90\%, depending on the system geometry. Significant reductions in the depinning field are also demonstrated in narrow strips by shifting the core away from the strips' centers.},
