	abstract = {With the advent of physical implementations of quantum walks, a general theoretical and efficient numerical framework is required for the study of their interactions with defects and disorder. In this paper, we derive analytic expressions for the eigenstates of a one-dimensional continuous-time quantum walk interacting with a single defect, before investigating the effects of multiple diagonal defects and disorder, with emphasis on its transmission and reflection properties. Complex resonance behavior is demonstrated, showing alternating bands of zero and perfect transmission for various defect parameters. Furthermore, we provide an efficient numerical method to characterize quantum walks in the presence of diagonal disorder, paving the way for selective control of quantum walks via the optimization of position-dependent defects. The numerical method can be readily extended to higher dimensions and multiple interacting walkers.},

	abstract = {We investigate the scattering properties of quantum walks by considering single and double position defects on a one-dimensional line. This corresponds to introducing, at designated positions, delta potential defects for continuous-time quantum walks and phase-defect Hadamard coins for discrete time quantum walks. The delta potential defects can be readily considered as potential barriers in discrete position space, which affect the time evolution of the system in a similar way as the quantum wave-packet dynamics in a continuous position space governed by Schr\"{o}dinger's equation. Although there is no direct analogy of potential barriers in the theoretical formulation of discrete time quantum walks, in this paper we show that the phase defects in the coin space can be utilized to provide similar scattering effects. This study provides means of controlling the scattering properties of quantum walks by introducing designated position-dependent defects.},
