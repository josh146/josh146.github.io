I'm a computational quantum physicist and software developer, working to build accessible, open-source
quantum software at [Xanadu](https://xanadu.ai). This includes:

<!-- * [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/), a Python library for differentiable programming of quantum computers -->
<!-- * [Strawberry Fields](https://strawberryfields.ai/), a Python library for designing, simulating, and optimizing continuous variable (CV) quantum optical circuits. -->
<!-- * [The Walrus](https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus), a Python/C++ library for the calculation of obscure, intractable graph quantities that are very important to quantum photonics and [Gaussian boson sampling](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_gbs.html). -->

A majority of my work is in Python, but I have also dabbled in Fortran, C, and C++. I believe that
code documentation is as---if not more---important as the underlying software, and this philosophy
has guided the development of each of the libraries listed above. I am also an advisor for the
[Unitary Fund](https://unitary.fund), a non-profit working to create an accessible quantum technology ecosystem.
As part of the advisory board I help to source and review microgrant applications.

Before joining Xanadu, I completed my PhD in quantum computation from the
[University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au/research/ems-research-clusters/quantum-information-simulation-and-algorithms), with a focus on graph algorithms. A large component
of my PhD included numerical simulation on [high performance supercomputing clusters](https://pawsey.org.au/),
working mostly with Fortran and Python.

Since then, my research interests have shifted to quantum machine learning and variational
quantum algorithms. In particular, exploring how we can [compute analytic quantum gradients
on hardware](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.99.032331),
[take advantage of the quantum geometry to improve optimization](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2020-05-25-269/),
and [use machine learning to design](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/aaf59e/meta)
[better](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.100.012326)
[photonic states](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.100.022341). For more
details, see my [publication list](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pEj09c4AAAAJ).

In addition to research and programming, I also enjoy science writing and communication.
Procrastination during my PhD resulted in my  writing being featured in [Australian
Geographic](https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2015/10/why-do-female-birds-sing-%281/) and
[Science](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/01/people-take-more-risks-when-wearing-helmets-potentially-negating-safety-benefits), and culminated in an undergraduate textbook for
[computational quantum mechanics](https://www.amazon.com/Computational-Quantum-Mechanics-Joshua-Izaac/dp/331999929X).

Luckily, my role at Xanadu has allowed me to continue down the science communication hole,
and since joining I have written about, illustrated, and highlighted various results from the quantum
machine learning literature, including the [quantum natural gradient](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quantum_natural_gradient.html),
[quantum stochastic gradient descent](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_doubly_stochastic.html),
[frugal shot optimization](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_rosalin.html),
[quantum backpropagation](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_backprop.html),
[Gaussian boson sampling](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_gbs.html)
and many others. I've also been lucky enough to give talks on quantum machine
learning and quantum photonics at conferences such as [QHACK](https://qhack.ai)
and [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org).
