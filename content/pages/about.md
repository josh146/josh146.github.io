Description: I'm a computational quantum physicist, former software developer, and product developer working to build accessible, open-source quantum software at Xanadu, a Toronto-based quantum photonic hardware company.

I'm a computational quantum physicist, [former quantum software developer](https://github.com/josh146),
and current Director of Product, working to build accessible, open-source quantum
software at [Xanadu](https://xanadu.ai). This includes:

During my coding days, a majority of my work is in Python, but I have also dabbled in Fortran, C,
and C++. I believe that accessible documentation is as---if not more---important as the underlying
software, and this philosophy has not only guided the development of each of the libraries listed
above, but governed the evolution of the PennyLane.ai web ecosystem, including:

- A library of 180+ [research-level demonstrations](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demonstrations) on
  topics across quantum computing;

- A [quantum compilation hub](https://pennylane.ai/compilation) detailing techniques,
  implementations, intermediate representations (and more);

- A [quantum codebook](https://pennylane.ai/codebook) that teaches beginner to advanced quantum computing topics through code; and

- A [lively community blog](https://pennylane.ai/blog) with over 100 posts.

To see more of the content I have written for PennyLane.ai, check out my
[PennyLane user profile](https://pennylane.ai/profile/josh/contributions).

In addition to the work I do at Xanadu building open-source quantum software products, I am also
involved in the wider quantum software community:

- I am a supporter and former advisory board member for the [Unitary Foundation](https://unitary.fund), a non-profit working to
  create an accessible quantum technology ecosystem.

- I co-organized the [Quantum Software 2.0](https://sites.google.com/view/quantum-software-2-0) workshop at IEEE Quantum Week 2024 (and its follow up,
  [Quantum Software 2.1](https://sites.google.com/view/quantum-software-workshop-2025), at IEEE
  Quantum Week 2025).

Before joining Xanadu, I completed my PhD in quantum computation from the
[University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au/research/ems-research-clusters/quantum-information-simulation-and-algorithms), with a focus on graph algorithms. A large component
of my PhD included numerical simulation on [high performance supercomputing clusters](https://pawsey.org.au/),
working mostly with Fortran and Python.

Since then, my research interests have shifted over the years. Until about 2022, my focus was on
quantum machine learning and quantum gradient methods. In particular, exploring how we can
[compute analytic quantum gradients on hardware](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.99.032331) and [generalizing this result](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2022-03-30-677/), [taking advantage of thequantum
geometry to improve optimization](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2020-05-25-269/), and
[use machine learning to design](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/aaf59e/meta)
[better](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.100.012326) [photonic states](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.100.022341). Since then, my research has shifted to exploring [hybrid quantum-classical
compilation in the context of structured, dynamic programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12449). 
For more details, see my [publication list](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pEj09c4AAAAJ).

In addition to research and programming, I also enjoy science writing and communication.
Procrastination during my PhD resulted in my writing being featured in [Australian
Geographic](https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2015/10/why-do-female-birds-sing-%281/) and
[Science](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/01/people-take-more-risks-when-wearing-helmets-potentially-negating-safety-benefits), and culminated in an undergraduate textbook for
[computational quantum mechanics](https://www.amazon.com/Computational-Quantum-Mechanics-Joshua-Izaac/dp/331999929X).

Luckily, my role at Xanadu has allowed me to continue down the science communication hole,
and since joining I have written about, illustrated, and highlighted various results from the quantum
machine learning literature, including the [quantum natural gradient](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quantum_natural_gradient.html),
[quantum stochastic gradient descent](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_doubly_stochastic.html),
[frugal shot optimization](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_rosalin.html),
[quantum backpropagation](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_backprop.html),
[Gaussian boson sampling](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_gbs.html)
and many others. I've also been lucky enough to give talks on quantum machine
learning and quantum photonics at conferences such as [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org)
and [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2021/).
